Question	What is the relative impact of rectal antiseptic preparation with povidone-iodine compared with targeted antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing post-biopsy sepsis following transrectal procedures, and could a combined strategy enhance infection control without contributing to antimicrobial resistance?	-	-	-
				
Cluster	Saline as Effective as Antiseptics for Post-Biopsy Infection Prevention	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	A study found that mechanical cleaning of rectal mucosa with saline was as effective as antiseptic solutions in reducing general complications, fever, acute prostatitis, and sepsis following TRUS-PB. This suggests saline, a cost-effective, side-effect-free, and easy-to-apply alternative, can be a viable infection prevention method, especially for patients with antiseptic allergies, prompting reconsideration of antiseptic solution necessity, despite study limitations including data gaps and absent rectal microorganism swab culture.

Nugget	The study aimed to investigate whether reduced infection rates were due to antiseptic solutions or the mechanical effect of rectal irrigation. Patients were randomized into three equal groups based on their rectal irrigation strategy, with the control group receiving rectal irrigation with physiological saline solution and antibiotic prophylaxis. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Mechanical cleaning methods with saline are cheap, easy to apply, and have no side effects, protecting against possible infections with similar efficacy to other antiseptic solutions. This challenges the prevailing belief that antiseptic solutions are indispensable for infection prevention. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	This randomized clinical trial, reported using the CONSORT checklist, involved flushing the rectal mucosa with 50 ml each of 10% povidone-iodine, 4% chlorhexidine, and saline via a pine-tipped syringe, followed by a two-minute wait for bactericidal effect; patients did not receive enema bowel preparation, and their cleansing methods were unknown to the doctor. Many studies indicate that these cheap, effective antiseptic solutions used for rectal mucosa cleaning positively contribute to infection control.

Nugget	Sepsis is one of the most dreaded complications following prostate biopsy, and rectal cleansing appeared to be the most effective strategy to reduce this risk. While cleansing agents varied, most studies used povidone-iodine; for example, in one analysis of 11 studies, nine reported on povidone-iodine, one on chlorhexidine, and one on an antimicrobial solution.

Cluster	Comparing Biopsy Methods: Infection, Antibiotics, and Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	TRUS biopsy was typically performed with local anaesthetic infiltration and pre- and post-procedure antibiotics as the standard-of-care at recruitment centers, but concerns about its infectious complications are now leading to the increasing popularity of local anaesthetic trans-perineal (LATP) biopsy. (Confidence: 100.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The TRANSLATE trial compared transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies, for which all participants received antibiotics, with local anaesthetic transperineal (LATP) biopsies, performed with chlorhexidine-based skin preparation and largely without antibiotics (89% of cases). The LATP approach resulted in fewer post-biopsy infections requiring hospitalisation (2 [<1%] vs 9 [2%] within 35 days) and fewer overall infectious complications (6 [1%] vs 13 [2%] over 4 months) compared to TRUS, demonstrating that most LATP biopsies can be safely performed without antibiotics, which is important for antibiotic stewardship.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy Prophylaxis: FQ Ban, Resistance, and Targeted Strategies	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The European Commission has implemented stringent regulatory conditions, suspending the indication for fluoroquinquinolones in peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate biopsy (EMEA/H/A-31/1452), thus they should not be used. While targeted prophylaxis based on rectal swab/stool culture is plausible and augmented prophylaxis without fluoroquinolones is a possibility, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are available for non-fluoroquinolone options nor is a standard combination established, with urologists advised to check local guidance for fosfomycin trometamol.

Nugget	Antimicrobial prophylaxis with TAZ/PIPC prevented prostatitis in positive-culture patients, averting potentially life-threatening sepsis and costly hospitalization. Culture-based, targeted prevention consequently reduces hospitalizations from antibiotic-resistant pathogens and lowers long-term healthcare costs, a crucial benefit given the European Commission's ban on fluoroquinolones (FQs) for urological perioperative prophylaxis due to a negative benefit-risk balance and rising drug resistance.

Nugget	Screening with selective media before TRPB in low infectious risk patients provides additive value in preventing post-biopsy prostatitis by enabling targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis against the rising trend of FQ-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli, for which TAZ/PIPC is recommended upon detection. This method accurately detects targeted resistant strains, such as LVFX-resistant bacteria identified in 28.6% of patients, with LVFX-insusceptible media demonstrating 98.1% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity.

Nugget	A meta-analysis of 15 studies with 12,320 patients found infectious complications after transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) were 3.4% with empirical antimicrobial prophylaxis but only 0.8% with targeted prophylaxis based on pre-biopsy rectal culture for resistant pathogens. A separate trial, focused on preventing acute post-biopsy prostatitis, demonstrated the effectiveness of rectal culture using selective media before TRPB to confirm resistant bacteria and guide antimicrobial selection, observing post-biopsy prostatitis in 4 (1.1%) patients who received either culture-based or no culture-based LVFX prophylaxis.

Nugget	Rectal cleansing prior to transrectal prostate biopsy significantly reduces bacterial introduction and infectious complications, emerging as potentially the most effective strategy. Its efficacy may surpass rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis and be comparable to or better than transperineal biopsy, with both rectal cleansing and culture-based prophylaxis being guideline-supported for transrectal procedures, though further comparative trials are needed.

Nugget	Although EAU guidelines recommend povidone-iodine rectal preparation prior to TRUS-PB, some included studies did not perform it, and others did not describe whether it was performed. Specifically, only one RCT (Sadahira et al. [7]) described performing this disinfection, while two RCTs [8,9] reported not performing it, and information on disinfection was not provided in the remaining studies.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: Tailored Antibiotics & Transperineal Approach	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	For transrectal prostate biopsy, there is moderate evidence from multiple studies and four meta-analyses that a combined strategy of targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (t-PAP), guided by pre-procedure rectal swab results, and povidone-iodine rectal disinfection effectively reduces postoperative infectious complications. Four of these meta-analyses specifically indicate t-PAP reduces infection risk by 40-80% compared to empirical prophylaxis, showing complication rates for t-PAP as low as 0.6-0.8% versus 3.1-3.4% for empirical PAP.

Nugget	Prostate biopsy, the primary method for diagnosing prostate cancer, can be performed via transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) approaches. Current studies suggest the TP approach does not require prophylactic antibiotic treatment (PAP) and should be favored over the TR approach, which always necessitates PAP, especially as global prostate cancer incidence and biopsy frequency are projected to double by 2040, making every instance of forgoing PAP a success.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy Routes, Antibiotic Prophylaxis, and Infection Risk	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	For transrectal biopsies, weak recommendations suggest using either targeted antibiotic prophylaxis based on rectal swab or stool culture, or augmented prophylaxis with two or more different antibiotic classes. However, the transperineal biopsy route is preferred over transrectal due to factors including antibiotic stewardship, feasibility under local anesthesia, and comparable cancer detection rates, despite potential logistical challenges.

Nugget	The PREVENT randomized trial [12] compared transperineal (TP) biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis to transrectal (TR) biopsy with targeted prophylaxis. For the TR approach, a rectal swab was performed prior to biopsy to screen for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, with targeted antibiotics administered based on culture and sensitivity results: fluoroquinolone prophylaxis if no resistance was detected, or an alternative antibiotic based on sensitivities for allergic patients or those with resistant strains.

Nugget	Antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory before transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) to prevent infectious complications, with fluoroquinolones (FQs) no longer accepted in the EU and current EAU guidelines recommending an algorithm where targeted prophylaxis (based on rectal swab results) is the first option but often unfeasible, still requiring non-quinolone antibiotics. The overall sepsis rate observed was 0.98%, with no significant difference between groups (0% vs. 1.96%, P = 0.50), including urosepsis confirmed once (0.98%) in Arm B. (Confidence: 100.0%)	RandomizedTrial1.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The comparison of urinary tract infection and sepsis rates following transperineal prostate biopsies suggests antibiotic prophylaxis may not be necessary for these procedures. This is relevant as antibiotic use, particularly unnecessary prophylactic administration, is associated with and exacerbates antibiotic resistance, a global health challenge affecting the entire medical system beyond urology, thereby supporting efforts to reduce antibiotic prescriptions to curb microbial resistance. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview3.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Targeted prophylactic antibiotics (TPAs) based on rectal swab culture significantly reduced the incidence of febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB) from 5.2% to 2.7% (a 46% reduction; RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.81, p = 0.003; NNT: 40) compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics. However, there was no statistically significant difference in sepsis incidence (1.3% vs 1.8%, RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.31-1.75, p = 0.4) between the two approaches.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: Prophylaxis, Complications, and Antimicrobial Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	In Germany, there is currently no gold standard for antibiotic choice in prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy; however, rectal disinfection with povidone-iodine immediately before the biopsy is recommended regardless of the antibiotic chosen. Targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (t-PAP) further limits broad-spectrum antibiotic use by over 80%, making it favorable for antibiotic stewardship [Cornford 2024].

Nugget	Fluoroquinolones, traditionally used for antibiotic prophylaxis in transrectal biopsies, are now challenged by increased resistance and stringent European regulations leading to their suspension for peri-operative use, prompting a shift to alternatives like cephalosporins or aminoglycosides where restricted. Other strategies include augmented prophylaxis (lacking standard combinations) and targeted prophylaxis based on rectal culture (without non-fluoroquinolone RCTs), while fosfomycin trometamol, despite some superiority data, has been withdrawn in Germany due to insufficient pharmacokinetic data, necessitating local guidance checks.

Cluster	Antibiotic Resistance: Infection Risk and Prophylaxis Strategies	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	None of the TRANSLATE recruitment centres used enhanced or rectal culture-guided prophylaxis, as these are not routinely used in the UK, nor did the UK study incorporate regular targeted antibiotic prophylaxis with pre-procedure rectal swabs, a practice that might be undertaken in some other countries. The necessary exclusion of participants at higher risk of infection for successful randomisation likely reduced the infection event rate in both groups of this study.

Cluster	TRUS-PB Sepsis Prophylaxis: Efficacy Inconclusive, More Research Needed	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The available evidence was insufficient to detect a statistically significant difference in sepsis risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.31-1.75, p = 0.5) between the two approaches, primarily because the low incidence rate of sepsis after TRUS-PB limited statistical power. Significant heterogeneity among included studies, potentially due to varying or absent sepsis definitions introducing classification bias, also reduced precision and indicates a need for further research.

Nugget	Transperineal biopsy (TPB) is strongly favored over transrectal biopsy (TRB) due to its lower infection risk; studies indicate TPB nearly eliminated post-biopsy sepsis or was comparable to TRB with augmented antibiotic prophylaxis even without periprocedural antibiotics. Conversely, targeted antimicrobials for TRB based on rectal swab culture failed to reduce sepsis risk compared to empirical prophylaxis, which TRB widely requires but still results in ~5% infectious complications, highlighting that antibiotic administration significantly influences bacterial resistance, associated with millions of global deaths.

Cluster	Rectal Cleansing Significantly Reduces Post-Procedural Sepsis	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Rectal cleansing (Arm 1) significantly reduced the sepsis event rate from 0.18% (33/1823) to 0.05% (10/1830), with an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 0.13% (NNT 769, OR 0.31, p=0.0011), whereas rectal culture-based prophylaxis (Arm 3) reduced rates from 0.15% (23/1473) to 0.08% (12/1430) with an ARR of 0.07% (NNT 1429), though this reduction was not statistically significant (OR 0.56, p=0.0855). (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview5.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Overall, rectal cleansing seemed to be the most effective strategy to prevent post-procedural sepsis, followed by rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis and transperineal biopsy. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview5.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
				
Cluster	Biopsy Infection Risks: TR vs. TP Approaches	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Post-biopsy sepsis is a rare complication, with one reported case among 1545 patients (TR: 1/762, TP: 0/783) including one grade 3 sepsis in the TR group in the PERFECT trial. The PREVENT trial indicated that transperineal biopsies without preventative antibiotics achieved similarly low infectious complications as transrectal biopsies using targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (recent update: 0/372 TP cases vs. 6/370 TR cases, difference -1%, p=0.01), with TR infections (1.6%) characterized as febrile but nonsevere.

Cluster	TRUS-PB Infection Prevention Strategies	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Several methods have been investigated to reduce infection rates after TRUS-PB, including augmented prophylactic antibiotics, povidone-iodine rectal preparation, and targeted prophylactic antibiotics (TPAs) based on rectal swab or stool cultures.

Cluster	Low Complications, No Significant Differences	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Overall complications occurred in 4%, and none of the patients developed sepsis. Despite distinct cleaning agents, there was no significant difference in infection rates (p = 0.780), fever incidence (p = 0.776), or pathological analyses (p = 0.764), and another instance of no statistically significant difference was found (p=0.329).

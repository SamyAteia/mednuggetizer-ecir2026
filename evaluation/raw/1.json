In general, the approaches are considered to provide similar diagnostic power. However, infectious complications appear to differ in favour of the TP approach. Furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis is felt to have limited additional value in a TP biopsy, which aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles. Urology association guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on the best approach for a prostate biopsy. This systematic review aims to compare the infectious complications and antibiotic usage of the two approaches.",
            "This study provides high-level evidence confirming that the transperineal (TP) biopsy route reduces the risk of hospital-isation due to infectious complications significantly compared with the transrectal route. It also highlights the lack of additional benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis in a TP biopsy, reinforcing antimicrobial stewardship principles. These find-ings address inconsistencies in existing urological guidelines and support the European Association of Urology recom-mendation of a TP biopsy as the preferred approach for prostate cancer diagnosis.",
            "Biopsies are traditionally performed along with antibi-otic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infectious complica-tions.

Postinterventional fever occurred less frequently, with an odds ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.52-0.89).

While recent randomized controlled trials comparing these approaches have reported inconclusive findings for cancer detection and infection rates\u2014potentially due to trial designs, inadequate power, and low event rates\u2014LATP showed fewer infections requiring hospital admission in the first 7 days (one [<1%] of 562 versus seven [1%] of 564 for TRUS) and fewer overall infectious complications in the 4-month post-biopsy period (six [1%] of 562 versus 13 [2%] of 564 for TRUS).",
        "In the first 7 days post-biopsy, infection requiring hospital admission occurred in 1 (<1%) of 562 individuals allocated to the LATP group versus 7 (1%) of 564 allocated to the TRUS group (OR 0.14 [95% CI 0.02-1-15]). Within 35 days, these figures increased to 2 (<1%) for LATP participants and 9 (2%) for TRUS participants, respectively.",
        "For transrectal prostate biopsy, moderate evidence from numerous low-to-moderate quality studies and four meta-analyses suggests that targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) guided by pre-procedural rectal swab results, coupled with Povidone-iodine rectal disinfection to minimize bacterial load, is suitable for reducing postoperative infectious complications. While one meta-analysis (Jazayeri et al. 2020) reported a lower but non-significant infection rate with targeted PAP, its authors still concluded its suitability; conversely, two recent RCTs (Jacewicz 2022; Chernyscheva 2021) found no higher rates of infection, fever, or sepsis when PAP was omitted.",
        "While transrectal prostate biopsy, even with preoperative rectal screening for multi-drug resistant organisms and targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (t-PAP) reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use by over 80% (favorable for antibiotic stewardship), still carries inherently higher infection rates (5-7%) and a sepsis risk (0.3-9.4%), the transperineal approach offers a superior alternative. Transperineal biopsy, with comparable tumor detection and a significantly lower infection rate (0% even without prophylaxis versus 1.4% for transrectal with PAP), can often entirely forgo antibiotic prophylaxis, thereby aligning more strongly with antibiotic stewardship principles, provided thorough perineal disinfection and urinary tract infection exclusion are performed.",
        "TRUS-PB remains the most commonly used and gold standard method for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, despite being a diagnostic method with high morbidity where complications can range from asymptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI) to sepsis and even death.",
        "While TRUS-PB remains the gold standard, rectal mucosa cleaning with antiseptic solutions (like chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine) is a validated method that reduces infectious complications. A study suggests that mechanical cleansing with saline is a cost-effective, side-effect-free alternative for infection prevention, particularly beneficial for patients with antiseptic allergies.",
        "Mechanical cleaning methods with saline are cheap, easy to apply, and have no side effects, protecting against possible infections like other antiseptic solutions with similar results for general complications, fever, acute prostatitis, and sepsis, and serving as an alternative for patients with antiseptic allergies.",
        "Transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB) is associated with worrying complications including infection, hospitalization, and sepsis, which can make patients reluctant to undergo repeat biopsies and results in significantly higher hospitalization rates. In contrast, the transperineal method has a lower incidence of infection, with no hospitalizations observed in one study of 245 patients.",
        "Given increasing infection rates and antibiotic resistance, particularly to commonly used quinolones, rectal cleansing with povidone-iodine combined with antibiotic prophylaxis during transrectal biopsy has been shown to reduce infectious complications. Current urology guidelines recommend this approach when local infectious complication rates are high.",
        "Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for transrectal prostate biopsy, involving targeted prophylaxis based on rectal or stool culture, augmented prophylaxis with two or more antibiotic classes, or alternative antibiotics such as cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefixime) and aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, amikacin). However, while fosfomycin trometamol (e.g., 3g before and 3g 24-48h after biopsy) is listed as an alternative, its indication for prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany due to manufacturers' failure to submit necessary pharmacokinetic data, requiring urologists to check local guidance regarding its use.",
        "Affirmed antibiotic prophylaxis strategies involve targeted prophylaxis based on a rectal swab or stool culture, and augmented prophylaxis with two or more different antibiotic classes.",
        "The transrectal approach is noted to contravene antibiotic stewardship principles, a central focus of the 2024 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on urological infections. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, emphasizing antimicrobial stewardship to minimize antibiotic use and combat the escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance through specific guidance on antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration, while acknowledging weak evidence for prophylaxis in some procedures like prostatectomy.",
        "Taking into account the feasibility of TP and TR biopsies under local anaesthesia, comparable csPCa detection rates, and the growing importance of antibiotic stewardship, the transperineal biopsy route is preferred over the transrectal route despite potential logistical challenges.",
        "For transrectal biopsy, either target prophylaxis based on rectal swab or stool culture, or augmented prophylaxis involving two or more different classes of antibiotics, is recommended (though this recommendation is weak); transperineal biopsy, however, requires routine surgical disinfection of the perineal skin.",
        "Rectal povidone-iodine cleansing before transrectal prostate biopsy, combined with antimicrobial prophylaxis, is strongly recommended due to a meta-analysis of eleven RCTs (2,237 men) showing it significantly lowers infectious complications (RR: 0.47; 95% CI [0.36\u20130.61]); conversely, the transperineal approach is strongly recommended for prostate biopsy given its low infectious risk and improved antibiotic stewardship.",
        "Given the projected doubling of global prostate cancer incidence by 2040, the transperineal biopsy approach, which current studies suggest does not require pre-procedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP), is favored over the transrectal approach, where PAP will always be necessary. This pragmatic and forward-looking perspective is supported by high-confidence studies showing no inferiority in infectious endpoints for PAP-free transperineal biopsy compared to PAP-accompanied transrectal biopsy, despite this being an \"apples-to-oranges comparison.\"",
        "EAU guidelines strongly favor transperineal biopsy (TPB) over transrectal biopsy (TRB) due to TPB's lower risk of infectious complications; while TRB requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and still reports ~5% infection rates, with targeted PAP efficacy and feasibility questioned, TPB has very rare infectious complications that PAP does not further reduce, making PAP omission advisable for TPB and aligning with antibiotic stewardship.",
        "According to new (2025) evidence-based recommendations, punch biopsies should be performed targeted, under imaging control, incorporating localization information, using either a transperineal or transrectal approach (Grade A). For high-risk patients, a rectal swab should also be performed (Grade B).",
        "Transrectal cleansing with Povidone-iodine is an additional measure to reduce infection during transrectal biopsy. This approach, supported by a meta-analysis of 11 studies (2,237 patients) showing a relative risk of 0.47 (95% CI 0.36-0.61), is a new consensus-based recommendation for 2025.",
        "Drei randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien, die transperineale und transrektale Biopsien verglichen, zeigten vergleichbare Prostatakarzinom-Detektionsraten und \u00e4hnliche Komplikationsraten bez\u00fcglich Harnverhalt. Zudem wiesen sie eine niedrige Infektionsrate auch im transrektalen Arm auf (1,4% vs. keine in der transperinealen Gruppe, 0,8% und 2,6% vs. 2,7% in der transperinealen Gruppe).",
        "An evidence-based recommendation (grade A), modified in 2025, states that transrectal core biopsy should be performed with antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "A meta-analysis of 11 studies (1,753 patients) demonstrated a significant reduction in infections with antibiotic prophylaxis during transrectal biopsy (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.77), recommending targeted prophylaxis via rectal swab for high-risk patients. Conversely, transperineal biopsy allows for the omission of antibiotic prophylaxis if no infection or prostatitis is present, with one systematic review showing no increased infection rate without its use (0.05% vs. 0.08%; p=0.2).",
        "Both transperineal and transrectal prostate biopsies are acceptable approaches, with transrectal biopsies requiring pre-procedural rectal cleansing or culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis (strategies proven and incorporated in guidelines) to address significant infectious complications, especially given millions of procedures yearly. Transperineal biopsies optimize antibiotic stewardship, but the comparative effectiveness of these and other strategies (like avoiding antibiotics for transperineal) remains unknown.",
        "Rectal cleansing prior to transrectal prostate biopsy appears to be the most effective strategy for reducing infectious complications, including sepsis, potentially outperforming transperineal biopsy and rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis. However, despite current guidelines recommending transperineal biopsy, its effectiveness compared to rectal cleansing and culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis remains unclear, necessitating further randomized controlled trials.",
        "Rectal cleansing appears to be the most effective strategy for preventing infectious complications, potentially comparable to or better than transperineal biopsy; however, many comparisons are indirect and recent trials show no significant difference between transrectal and transperineal approaches. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to abandon transrectal biopsy, particularly when combined with pre-procedural rectal cleansing or culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis, and further direct RCTs are needed to determine the safest approach.",
        "While direct comparisons are scarce, current findings suggest insufficient evidence to recommend abandoning transrectal prostate biopsy, making it a prudent option for urologists and further trials alongside transperineal biopsy. For transrectal biopsy, pre-procedural rectal cleansing or rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduce infectious complications, potentially equalling or surpassing transperineal outcomes, and are recommended over empirical antibiotics alone.",
        "While guidelines now recommend transperineal (TPB) over transrectal (TRB) prostate biopsy, and empirical antibiotics alone are not recommended for TRB, there is insufficient evidence to abandon TRB when combined with rectal cleansing and culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis. These modifications significantly reduce infectious complications, potentially comparable to or even better than TPB, but direct comparisons are scarce, necessitating further RCTs to determine the safest approach.",
        "Despite European Association of Urology guidelines recommending the transperineal (TP) approach, the choice between transrectal (TR) and TP techniques for Tbx remains debated. Current evidence shows no clear advantage of TP-Tbx over TR-Tbx, with both methods having similar PCa detection rates and comparable rates of infections, urinary retention, and biopsy-associated pain.",
        "Based on three RCTs (PREVENT, ProBE-PC, PERFECT), the TR technique, commonly administered with antibiotic prophylaxis to mitigate infection risks or after a rectal swab, showed no difference from TP-Tbx in detecting csPCa (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7-1.1) or ISUP 1 PCa (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8-1.4), with similar postprocedural infection (OR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8), sepsis (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.1-4.5), and urinary retention rates (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.1-1.6).",
        "A meta-analysis reaffirmed no clear superiority of the transperineal (TP-Tbx) over the transrectal (TR-Tbx) approach for infection prevention or overall cancer detection, with both demonstrating similar efficacy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and diagnostic utility. Although high-quality evidence within the study specifically favored TP for prostate cancer detection, the overall findings suggest that excluding TR from current practices may be moderated, despite international guidelines favoring TP.",
        "TP-Tbx and TR-Tbx show similar results in detecting PCa, with comparable rates of infection, urinary retention, and effectiveness in managing biopsy-associated pain; however, TP-Tbx can safely omit antibiotics without increasing infection risk, unlike TR-Tbx, which aligns with antibiotic stewardship goals. Despite no clear overall advantage of TP-Tbx in current evidence, preliminary, non-statistically significant findings suggest it may result in lower sepsis rates, with the directionality in key outcomes (infection and sepsis) favoring the TP approach and warranting further investigation, which indicates the tendency to exclude TR-Tbx with prophylactic antibiotics could be moderated.",
        "The transperineal (TP) approach is primarily used not to reduce mild infections, but because numerous prospective and retrospective reviews demonstrate an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis. Although sepsis is a relatively rare event, the TP approach offers advantages over the transrectal (TR) method, which typically requires more comprehensive antibiotic protocols; for instance, the PREVENT trial reported no infections in 372 TP cases compared to six in 370 TR cases (difference of -1%, 95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01).",
        "While transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) prostate biopsy approaches show no significant differences in prostate cancer detection and complications, the MRI-targeted TP approach may be advantageous as it can be performed safely without antibiotics, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance.",
        "The benefits of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted transperineal (TP) prostate biopsy (TP-Tbx) versus transrectal (TR) approaches are still a matter of debate. A review aims to compare the efficacy and safety of TP-Tbx and MRI-targeted TR biopsy (TR-Tbx).",
        "Despite lower upfront procedural costs, the TR-Tbx approach may incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges due to the necessity of preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis. The TR approach also has a higher chance of infection, up to 5-7% [22] in real-world data, due to rectal mucosa involvement, typically requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols.",
        "In the PREVENT randomized trial [12], TP biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to TR biopsy using targeted prophylaxis. For the TR approach, a pre-biopsy rectal swab screened for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, and based on culture and sensitivity results, targeted antibiotics were administered; fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was given if no resistance was detected, while allergic or resistant cases received an alternative antibiotic based on identified sensitivities.",
        "Both biopsy approaches demonstrate low overall toxicity, are generally safe for clinical use in the populations studied, and the transperineal (TP) approach does not carry an increasing risk of urinary retention. While there is a clear trend across studies to minimize antibiotic use to reduce antibiotic resistance, recent European Association of Urology guidelines specifically direct urologists towards the TP approach.",
        "The PREVENT trial found no infections in 372 transperineal (TP) cases, versus six (1.6%) febrile but nonsevere infections in 370 transrectal (TR) cases, showing a -1% difference (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p=0.01). Notably, TP biopsies without preventative antibiotics and TR biopsies with targeted antibiotic prophylaxis both showed no significant infectious complications, although the ProBE-PC study reported that all TR procedures used 1-day antibiotic prophylaxis without rectal cultures, unlike TP.",
        "Preliminary evidence suggests a directionality in key outcomes, including infection and sepsis, that appears to favor TP-Tbx; however, these non-statistically significant findings warrant further investigation to confirm their potential advantages.",
        "TP-Tbx could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with antibiotic stewardship goals and reducing reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are important factors in selecting the optimal biopsy technique. Concurrently, the tendency to exclude TR-Tbx with prophylactic antibiotics due to infection concerns could be moderated.",
        "Despite EAU guidelines recommending transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TPUS-PB) for its lower infection rate, transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-PB) remains widely used and plays an important role in real-world practice, mainly due to TPUS-PB's complex technical demands and higher patient discomfort, while TRUS is also the least costly option.",
        "A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs found that targeted prophylactic antibiotics (TPAs) based on rectal swab culture, when used prior to TRUS-PB for PCa diagnosis, significantly reduce the incidence of febrile UTI (fUTI) by twofold compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics; however, there was insufficient evidence to show a significant difference regarding the risk of sepsis.",
        "We recommend performing rectal swab-based TPAs in patients undergoing TRUS-PB due to a clinically relevant reduction in fUTI incidence; however, their overall effect remains unclear despite being studied in randomized controlled trials, likely due to small sample sizes.",
        "Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB) remains widely used for diagnosing prostate cancer due to its lower cost, simplicity, and widespread availability, and because the guideline-recommended transperineal approach (TPUS-PB) has greater patient discomfort and complex technical demands, despite TPUS-PB allowing antibiotic prophylaxis omission. While TRUS-PB is associated with significant infectious complications, these can be halved by using culture-guided antibiotics.",
        "While EAU guidelines recommend TPUS-PB as the first choice, for planned TRUS-PB, Targeted Prophylactic Antibiotic Strategy (TPAS) based on rectal swab culture should be considered to increase patient safety by reducing infectious complications. Although the EAU also recommends povidone-iodine rectal preparation prior to TRUS-PB, studies show significant heterogeneity due to inconsistent performance or reporting of this disinfection.",
        "The study aimed to assess the efficacy of targeted prophylactic antibiotics (TPAs), based on rectal swabs, in reducing infectious complications after TRUS-PB compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics. This follows a previous meta-analysis [6] which showed that combining prophylactic antibiotics with povidone-iodine rectal preparation before TRUS-PB significantly reduces the incidence of febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) compared to empiric prophylactic antibiotic monotherapy (RR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.3-0.75, p = 0.001).",
        "TPAs based on rectal swab culture significantly decreased the rate of fUTI after TRUS-PB, resulting in a 46% and twofold reduction in risk compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics.",
        "Two RCTs (ProBE-PC and PREVENT) investigated the infection rates of TPBx and TRBx [26,32], with key findings from one trial showing no significant difference in composite infection rates (0% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.059) between them [32]. TPBx, however, offers an advantage regarding infectious complications by completely excluding the inherent risk of seeding bacteria into the rectum, as it does not pass through the rectal mucosa.",
        "Transperineal biopsy (TPBx) is increasingly favored and strongly recommended by the European Association of Urology due to its diagnostic advantages, safety, and lower risk of infectious complications, a shift from transrectal biopsy (TRBx), which became standard in the 1980s. This deviation, termed \"TRexit,\" aims to mitigate infection and resistant microbial strain risks while preserving diagnostic precision, with global adoption rising from 14% to 25% in the UK (2014-2017) and from 26% to 57% in Australia/New Zealand (2015-2019).",
        "Two RCTs, ProBE-PC (monocentric, 753 patients, 30-day composite infection rate) and PREVENT (multicenter, 658 patients, 7-day post-biopsy infection rates), found no significant difference in composite infection rates between transperineal (TPBx) and transrectal (TRBx) biopsies (2.7% vs. 2.6%, p=0.89 for ProBE-PC; 0% vs. 1.4%, p=0.059 for PREVENT). While TRBx involved targeted antibiotics based on rectal cultures, TPBx typically either prescribed antibiotics without cultures (employing augmented oral therapy or intramuscular ceftriaxone) or omitted prophylaxis in most cases (98.9%), and neither approach induced sepsis in the ProBE-PC trial.",
        "TRBx inherently carries a potential for infection, particularly sepsis, with numerous studies, including He et al. [10], demonstrating a much higher incidence of infectious complications such as symptomatic UTIs and fever, compared to TPBx. However, key findings reported no significant difference in composite infection rates (2.7% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.89) between the two approaches, and one study [33] found neither method induced sepsis.",
        "The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines maintain a neutral position on both transrectal and transperineal approaches due to a lack of comparative RCTs on infection rates, also stating that the value of prophylactic antibiotics in TPBx is unknown and its wider implementation requires adequate training and resources. Meanwhile, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines describe growing evidence suggesting antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for TPBx, but the panel awaits ongoing RCT findings, mindful that unnecessary prophylactic antibiotic administration can lead to antibiotic resistance across the medical system.",
        "\"TRexit\" signifies a shift away from transrectal practices in prostate biopsy, aiming to mitigate infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains while preserving diagnostic precision, despite transrectal biopsy (TRBx) still being asserted as easy, effective, and safe to use.",
        "Data substantiate the safety and effectiveness of performing Transperineal Biopsy (TPBx) without antibiotic prophylaxis in 98.9% of cases, as confirmed by two RCTs. This approach directly supports antibiotic stewardship by reducing antibiotic overuse and curbing microbial resistance, global health challenges, while ensuring patient safety and preserving diagnostic precision by mitigating infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains.",
        "The exclusive adoption of transperineal (TP) biopsies reduces antibiotic usage by decreasing infectious complications and safely omitting periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis. This is a crucial point for the urological community's debate on optimal biopsy approaches, given the significant implications of antibiotic overuse and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for individual patients, the general population, and their microbiome.",
        "A systematic review, including a subgroup analysis of ten studies and randomized data such as the NORAPP trial, found no statistically significant difference in overall infectious complications, hospitalizations, or febrile infectious outcomes (p=0.47) when comparing transperineal (TP) biopsies performed with and without antibiotic prophylaxis. Therefore, for patients without risk factors, it may be considered safe to forgo antibiotic prophylaxis in TP biopsies, a conclusion consistent with and extending existing evidence.",
        "Urology association guidelines from the two major organizations, the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), provide conflicting recommendations on the best prostate biopsy approach. The EAU strongly recommends the Transperineal (TP) approach, citing reduced infectious complications and supporting it as the preferred method for prostate cancer diagnosis, while the AUA offers no clear guidance due to limited randomized controlled trial data, considering both TP and Transrectal (TR) approaches safe and appropriate.",
        "Biopsies traditionally involve antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce infectious complications, but growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the adoption of antimicrobial stewardship necessitate approaches that reduce antibiotic use. In included trials, antibiotic prophylaxis used fluoroquinolone-based regimens, which are now critically viewed due to high AMR levels, a low threshold for acquiring resistance, and increasing awareness of their side-effect profile among providers and patients.",
        "The EAU strongly recommends the Transperineal (TP) approach due to its reduced incidence of infectious complications, while the AUA, citing limited RCT data, offers unclear guidance but considers both TP and Transrectal (TR) approaches safe and appropriate diagnostic procedures. Although both approaches provide similar diagnostic power, infectious complications appear to favor TP, thus future research must be adequately powered and follow standardized definitions for infectious outcomes.",
        "A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing transrectal (TR) and transperineal (TP) prostate biopsy techniques, which offer similar diagnostic power, found that the TP route significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization due to infectious complications. This evidence reinforces antimicrobial stewardship principles by highlighting the lack of additional benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis in TP biopsies, addressing previous urological guideline inconsistencies and supporting the European Association of Urology's recommendation of TP as the preferred approach for prostate cancer diagnosis.",
        "An updated meta-analysis of ten RCTs (4188 prostate biopsies) found the transperineal (TP) approach to be associated with lower rates of infectious complications, including hospitalisation (77% reduced risk; odds ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54) and fever (odds ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89), compared to the transrectal (TR) route. Notably, all TR biopsies utilized antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas TP biopsies showed no significant difference in infectious complications with or without antibiotics.",
        "High-level evidence confirms that the transperineal (TP) biopsy route significantly reduces the risk of infectious complications requiring hospitalisation compared to the transrectal route. Hospitalisation serves as the most sensitive surrogate for serious infections (not meeting sepsis criteria), reflecting increased severity of complications and a higher risk of sepsis; furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis offers no additional benefit in a TP biopsy, reinforcing antimicrobial stewardship principles.",
        "Ten RCTs comparing TP and TR approaches reported infectious complications after a prostate biopsy, with seven studies showing a 77% lower risk of hospitalization for infectious complications with a TP biopsy than a TR biopsy. Hospitalization reflects increased severity of complications and a higher risk of sepsis, making it the most sensitive surrogate for serious infections not meeting sepsis criteria.",
        "An overall common effect model revealed a significant difference (z = \u22123.36; p < 0.001) in the likelihood of admission for infectious complications, with the transperineal (TP) approach demonstrating 77% lower odds of admission (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54) compared to the transrectal (TR) route. Supported by seven studies, the absolute hospitalization risks were 0.026% for TP versus 1.47% for TR; overall sepsis rates were low (TR: 3, TP: 1) and no mortality was reported.",
        "Prostate biopsies can be performed via either a transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) route. The TP approach generally causes fewer infectious complications, with current literature suggesting safe omission of periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis [11], whereas TR biopsies are less resource-intensive and postulated to cause less patient discomfort, but require antibiotic prophylaxis and carry concerns of a higher risk of severe infections.",
        "TP biopsy is associated with a lower admission risk due to postprocedural infection compared with TR biopsy and appears to be a safe procedure without antibiotics in patients without risk factors, advocating for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in urology.",
        "While a transperineal (TP) biopsy may reduce infection-related morbidity and antibiotic use, and some studies in selected low-risk patients reported no increase in infections without antibiotics, further adequately powered research is needed across broader populations and healthcare systems, using standardized infectious outcome definitions, before changing routine practice.",
        "Transperineal (TP) biopsy is associated with a lower admission risk due to postprocedural infection compared to transrectal (TR) biopsy (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.55); the overall difference between methods is statistically significant (p=0.005) with an RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.90) favoring TP. While all TR biopsies utilized antibiotic prophylaxis, there was no statistically significant difference in infectious complications after TP biopsy with or without antibiotics.",
        "Clear international guidance on biopsy routes and infection risk, grounded in robust evidence, is needed to support consistent and safe clinical practice across regions. These results may help inform decisions about biopsy technique and infection prevention strategies.",
        "Prostate biopsies are a key step in diagnosing prostate cancer, performed via either transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) routes. While both approaches offer similar diagnostic power, the TP approach generally results in fewer infectious complications.",
        "Antibiotic prophylaxis has limited additional value in transperineal (TP) biopsies, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles; in contrast, other procedures are less resource intensive but require antibiotic prophylaxis and raise concerns of a higher risk of severe infections.",
        "There was a significant association between biopsy approaches and fever, with fever occurring more frequently after TR biopsies, while the TP route showed less frequent postinterventional fever (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89). Furthermore, the TP route significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for infectious complications by 77% compared to the TR route (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54), with no statistically significant difference in infectious complications for TP biopsies whether antibiotics were used or not, unlike TR biopsies which universally utilized antibiotic prophylaxis."

                "EAU guidelines strongly favor transperineal biopsy (TPB) over transrectal biopsy (TRB) due to TPB's lower risk of infectious complications; while TRB requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and still reports ~5% infection rates, with targeted PAP efficacy and feasibility questioned, TPB has very rare infectious complications that PAP does not further reduce, making PAP omission advisable for TPB and aligning with antibiotic stewardship.",
                "In the PREVENT randomized trial [12], TP biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to TR biopsy using targeted prophylaxis. For the TR approach, a pre-biopsy rectal swab screened for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, and based on culture and sensitivity results, targeted antibiotics were administered; fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was given if no resistance was detected, while allergic or resistant cases received an alternative antibiotic based on identified sensitivities.",
                "Data substantiate the safety and effectiveness of performing Transperineal Biopsy (TPBx) without antibiotic prophylaxis in 98.9% of cases, as confirmed by two RCTs. This approach directly supports antibiotic stewardship by reducing antibiotic overuse and curbing microbial resistance, global health challenges, while ensuring patient safety and preserving diagnostic precision by mitigating infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains.",
                "TP biopsy is associated with a lower admission risk due to postprocedural infection compared with TR biopsy and appears to be a safe procedure without antibiotics in patients without risk factors, advocating for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in urology.",
                "While a transperineal (TP) biopsy may reduce infection-related morbidity and antibiotic use, and some studies in selected low-risk patients reported no increase in infections without antibiotics, further adequately powered research is needed across broader populations and healthcare systems, using standardized infectious outcome definitions, before changing routine practice.",
                "Transperineal (TP) biopsy is associated with a lower admission risk due to postprocedural infection compared to transrectal (TR) biopsy (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.55); the overall difference between methods is statistically significant (p=0.005) with an RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.90) favoring TP. While all TR biopsies utilized antibiotic prophylaxis, there was no statistically significant difference in infectious complications after TP biopsy with or without antibiotics."

This is further supported by a systematic review reporting sepsis rates of 0.9% for transrectal versus 0.1% for transperineal biopsies and a population-based study showing higher re-admission rates for sepsis (1.4% vs 1.0%, respectively), establishing transperineal as the 1st choice and transrectal as the 2nd.",

Zudem wiesen sie eine niedrige Infektionsrate auch im transrektalen Arm auf (1,4% vs. keine in der transperinealen Gruppe, 0,8% und 2,6% vs. 2,7% in der transperinealen Gruppe).",
                "The transperineal (TP) approach is primarily used not to reduce mild infections, but because numerous prospective and retrospective reviews demonstrate an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis. Although sepsis is a relatively rare event, the TP approach offers advantages over the transrectal (TR) method, which typically requires more comprehensive antibiotic protocols; for instance, the PREVENT trial reported no infections in 372 TP cases compared to six in 370 TR cases (difference of -1%, 95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01).",
                "An overall common effect model revealed a significant difference (z = \u22123.36; p < 0.001) in the likelihood of admission for infectious complications, with the transperineal (TP) approach demonstrating 77% lower odds of admission (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54) compared to the transrectal (TR) route. Supported by seven studies, the absolute hospitalization risks were 0.026% for TP versus 1.47% for TR; overall sepsis rates were low (TR: 3, TP: 1) and no mortality was reported."

While TRUS-PB is associated with significant infectious complications, these can be halved by using culture-guided antibiotics."

While there is a clear trend across studies to minimize antibiotic use to reduce antibiotic resistance, recent European Association of Urology guidelines specifically direct urologists towards the TP approach.",

Meanwhile, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines describe growing evidence suggesting antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for TPBx, but the panel awaits ongoing RCT findings, mindful that unnecessary prophylactic antibiotic administration can lead to antibiotic resistance across the medical system.",

                    "Biopsies traditionally involve antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce infectious complications, but growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the adoption of antimicrobial stewardship necessitate approaches that reduce antibiotic use. In included trials, antibiotic prophylaxis used fluoroquinolone-based regimens, which are now critically viewed due to high AMR levels, a low threshold for acquiring resistance, and increasing awareness of their side-effect profile among providers and patients.

Additional precautions to reduce infection include disposable needles, povidone-iodine needle cleaning, rectal swab culture, and rectal mucosa cleaning with antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine/povidone-iodine) or saline, which is cheap, easy, and provides protection against infections, serving as an alternative for those with antiseptic allergies.",

        "Transperineal biopsy (TP-Tbx) can safely omit prophylactic antibiotics without increasing infection risk, effectively supporting antibiotic stewardship and reducing reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics. This contrasts with transrectal biopsy (TR-Tbx) and its infection concerns, making TP-Tbx the favored approach for infection-related outcomes, despite some lacking statistical significance.",
        "The transperineal (TP) approach significantly mitigates infection risk by avoiding the rectal mucosa, resulting in an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis (0.1% compared to 0.8% for the transrectal (TR) approach, as per a systematic review of 165 studies and 162,577 patients); however, TP often necessitates more extensive preparation and potentially general anesthesia.",
        "The TR approach has a higher infection chance (up to 5-7% in real-world data [22]) due to rectal mucosa involvement, typically requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols, which contrasts with the clear trend toward minimizing antibiotic use to reduce antibiotic resistance.",
        "The PREVENT trial [12] showed that transperineal (TP) biopsies without preventative antibiotics had no significant infectious complications (0 out of 372 cases), similar to transrectal (TR) biopsies using targeted prophylaxis which had a 1.6% incidence (6 out of 370 cases) of febrile but nonsevere infections, a difference of -1% (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01). The ProBE-PC study [13] observed that TR procedures employed 1-day antibiotic prophylaxis (without rectal cultures), while TP procedures did so only occasionally.",
        "The decision regarding biopsy choice is influenced by factors such as diagnostic accuracy, procedural safety, patient comfort, instrument availability, and the procedure's costs and time; notably, while TR-Tbx has lower upfront procedural costs, it can incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges due to the necessity of preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "A meta-analysis found no clear superiority of the TP-Tbx approach over TR-Tbx for infection prevention and cancer detection, despite international guidelines favoring TP. Although key outcomes like infection and sepsis show a directionality favoring TP, this lacks statistical significance, suggesting that the exclusion of TR-Tbx from practice may be moderated and warrants further investigation.",
        "In the PREVENT randomized trial, where TP biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to TR biopsy using targeted prophylaxis, the TR approach involved a pre-biopsy rectal swab to screen for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms. Based on culture and sensitivity results, targeted antibiotics were administered; fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was provided if no resistance was detected, or an alternative antibiotic was used for allergic patients or those with resistant strains based on identified sensitivities.",
        "These results, coupled with ongoing shifts toward TP-Tbx in local anesthesia, support a reconsideration of current biopsy protocols, potentially favoring TP-Tbx as a standard practice. This change could align clinical practices with economic and public health benefits, and reduced antibiotic usage.",
        "The MRI-targeted transperineal (TP) prostate biopsy approach may be advantageous as it can be performed safely without antibiotics, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance; however, its overall benefits in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and safety versus transrectal (TR) approaches are still a matter of debate.",
        "Historically, the transrectal (TR) approach was favored for its less invasive nature, ease of use, and quick performance without general anesthesia, and was commonly administered with antibiotic prophylaxis or after a rectal swab to mitigate infection risks. However, this method is increasingly investigated due to a higher incidence of severe infectious complications that may require hospitalization.",
        "TP-Tbx can safely omit antibiotics without increasing infection risk, unlike TR-Tbx. However, current evidence does not show a clear advantage of TP-Tbx over TR-Tbx, and the tendency to exclude TR-Tbx with prophylactic antibiotics due to infection concerns could be moderated.",
        "The choice of biopsy approach holds broad relevance as it impacts clinical outcomes, healthcare resources, and patient quality of life; however, the multicenter nature of studies and varying clinician experience and equipment across sites may influence the reproducibility of biopsy techniques.",
        "From pragmatic and forward-looking perspectives, the transperineal biopsy (TPB) approach should be favored, as current high-confidence studies suggest it does not require prophylactic antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and is not inferior in infectious endpoints compared to PAP-accompanied transrectal biopsy (TRB), which always necessitates PAP. This choice is particularly relevant given the projected doubling of global prostate cancer incidence by 2040 and the questionable feasibility of routinely implementing rectal cultures for targeted PAP in TRB.",
        "EAU guidelines strongly favor transperineal biopsy (TPB) over transrectal biopsy (TRB) due to a lower risk of infectious complications. This choice is further supported in settings with microbiological resistance concerns and resource limitations, as TRB requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and still reports ~5% infection rates, while TPB allows for PAP omission without increasing infectious complications, aligning with antibiotic stewardship and mitigating resistance where targeted prophylaxis for TRB may not be feasible.",
        "Despite EAU guidelines not recommending fluoroquinolones as prophylactic antibiotics before TRUS-PB due to their adverse effect profile and increased quinolone-resistant microorganisms, most RCTs still utilized them empirically or when rectal swab cultures were negative. Consequently, since prophylactic antibiotic usage is anticipated to change, these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to current and future clinical practice.",
        "A US private insurance claims study [22] revealed TRUS prostate biopsy ($1869) as the least costly, compared to TPUS ($2849) and MRI/ultrasound fusion ($4396). High costs, specific equipment, and expertise required for MRI-guided and TPUS techniques limit their accessibility, ensuring TRUS-PB's continued role in practice despite their theoretical advantages [21, 22].",
        "TPAs based on rectal swab culture reduced the risk of fUTI by 46% compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics; however, the influence of quinolone-resistant bacteria on this effectiveness remains unclear as its varying prevalence was not considered, and these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to current or future clinical practice due to anticipated changes in prophylactic antibiotic usage.",
        "Transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TPUS-PB) is the guideline-recommended primary procedure for diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa), notably allowing antibiotic prophylaxis omission while maintaining comparable detection and complication rates to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB). However, TRUS-PB, also a primary diagnostic method, is still widely used in many institutions despite its significant infectious complication rate, owing to its low cost, procedural simplicity, short learning curve, and widespread availability.",
        "The transrectal approach remains widely recommended and used due to the complex technical demands and higher patient discomfort associated with transperineal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TPUS-PB).",
        "TPUS-PB allows for the omission of antibiotic prophylaxis while maintaining comparable detection and complication rates to TRUS-PB.

        "Although TPUS-PB is recommended in the current European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines due to its lower infection rate, TRUS-guided biopsy remains widely used across various clinical settings [3].",
        "Performing rectal swab-based TPAs is recommended in patients undergoing TRUS-PB for PCa diagnosis, as it significantly and clinically relevantly reduces the incidence of fUTI compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics.",
        "While LATP biopsy was more immediately painful (38% vs 27%; OR 1.84) and embarrassing and took longer to perform than TRUS, fewer men in the LATP group received less than six systematic biopsy cores despite its lower tolerance, implying poor tolerance does not necessarily lead to suboptimal sampling. There was no difference in overall biopsy-related complications, though TRUS had higher procedure-related symptoms at 7 days, with no difference in quality of life.",
        "The TRANSLATE study comprehensively evaluated LATP against TRUS biopsy for non-infectious complications (including post-procedure bleeding, acute urinary retention, effects on urinary and sexual function, and procedure tolerability) immediately, at 7 and 35 days, and at 4 months post-procedure. TRUS biopsy was performed using local anaesthetic infiltration, with pre-procedure and post-procedure antibiotics as standard-of-care at each recruitment centre.",
        "For prostate cancer diagnosis, local anaesthetic transperineal (LATP) biopsy is gaining popularity over traditional transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, primarily due to concerns about infectious complications with TRUS and LATP's perceived superior targeting of MRI-visible lesions. However, uncertainties persist regarding LATP's infection rates, prostate sampling, tolerability, side-effects, and cost-effectiveness, with the TRANSLATE trial providing evidence to inform the trade-offs in choosing between these methods.",
        "The TRANSLATE trial reported fewer infections (including those requiring hospital admission) for LATP versus TRUS, although this difference was not statistically significant given it was a secondary outcome for which the trial was not powered. To increase diversity, TRANSLATE excluded London and many other major UK cities where hospitals had already fully transitioned to LATP.",
        "The TRANSLATE trial found LATP detected GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer in 60.1% (329/547) of participants compared to 54.4% (294/540) for TRUS biopsy (OR 1.32, p=0.031), demonstrating greater detection; however, LATP caused higher immediate post-procedure pain/embarrassment and took longer, while TRUS biopsy resulted in more procedure-related symptoms beyond 7 days. Systematic biopsies are crucial for overall detection of GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer, and regional biopsies add value beyond target-only approaches.",

Despite these factors, its overall reported infection rates were higher than other studies due to comprehensive data collection.",
        "The TRANSLATE study found that local anaesthetic transperineal (LATP) biopsies led to fewer post-biopsy infection hospitalisations compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies, and that most LATP biopsies can be safely performed without antibiotics, given 89% of LATP cases did not receive them (with the 11% that did largely being protocol deviations), which supports antibiotic stewardship, with overall infection rates being low and comparable to PROBE-PC and PREVENT.18.",
        "Most participants who received LATP underwent biopsy without antibiotics according to protocol (503 [89%] of 567), with the remaining 11% largely due to protocol deviations, while all participants in the TRUS group received antibiotics; LATP also resulted in fewer post-biopsy infection hospitalizations compared to TRUS.",
        "The transition from TRUS to LATP biopsy has been driven by concerns over infectious complications, particularly post-biopsy urinary sepsis, with patient-specific factors like concurrent urinary tract infection, immunocompromise, enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis needs, absent rectum, or inability to position in lithotomy also being critical considerations. However, a comprehensive evaluation encompassing infection rates and non-infectious complications\u2014such as bleeding, acute urinary retention, urinary/sexual function impact, procedure tolerability, quality of life, and secondary histopathological findings\u2014observed no difference between LATP and TRUS in participants reporting one or more biopsy-related complication.",
        "For post-biopsy infection requiring hospital admission, LATP participants had lower rates than TRUS participants, with 1 (<1%) of 562 versus 7 (1%) of 564 within 7 days (OR 0.14 [95% CI 0.02-1.15]), and 2 (<1%) of 562 versus 9 (2%) of 564 within 35 days. Over a 4-month post-biopsy period, LATP also showed fewer overall infectious complications (6 [1%] of 562) compared to TRUS (13 [2%] of 564), with an adjusted OR of 0.45 [0.17-1.20].",
        "TRBx inherently risks infection, particularly sepsis, with numerous studies consistently demonstrating a higher incidence of infectious complications, including symptomatic UTIs and fever, compared to TPBx (e.g., He et al. [10]). For TRBx, antibiotics were administered together with rectal cultures, and targeted antibiotics were prescribed.",
        "Transperineal biopsy (TPBx) inherently avoids infectious complications associated with transrectal biopsy (TRBx) by not passing through the rectal mucosa, and while there is growing evidence suggesting antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for TPBx, guidelines note a lack of RCTs comparing infection rates or confirming the value of prophylaxis. Furthermore, adequate training and resources, which are currently limited among many trainees, are essential for TPBx's wider implementation.",
        "The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on prostate cancer strongly recommend the transperineal approach for prostate biopsy due to its lower risk of infectious complications [28]. While emerging evidence and a meta-analysis suggest antibiotic prophylaxis may not be necessary for transperineal biopsies\u2014finding no significant differences in UTI and sepsis rates\u2014formal recommendations are pending further research, though high-risk patients for UTIs may still benefit.",
        "Global health challenges from antibiotic resistance are exacerbated by antibiotic overuse and unnecessary prophylaxis; however, a meta-analysis demonstrated that transperineal biopsy can be safely performed without antibiotics, supporting reduced prescriptions and curbing resistance. Crucially, study findings were influenced by specific clinical settings, patient demographics, and local microbial flora, which affect infection rates and how selected antibiotics impact flora, underscoring the need for long-term studies on omitting prophylaxis and its effect on community resistance patterns.",
        "\"TRexit\" refers to a deviation from transrectal practices in prostate biopsy, with the objectives of mitigating infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains, while preserving diagnostic precision.",
        "While transrectal and transperineal biopsy approaches offer similar diagnostic power, the transperineal (TP) approach is strongly recommended by the EAU due to fewer infectious complications and the safety of omitting periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis, which collectively reduces antibiotic usage.",
        "TP biopsy, appearing safe without antibiotics in patients without risk factors, significantly reduces antibiotic usage by lowering infectious complications and post-procedural admission risks compared to TR biopsy. This approach supports enhanced antimicrobial stewardship by addressing the major implications of antibiotic overuse and associated antimicrobial resistance for individual patients and the general population.",
        "Biopsies traditionally utilize antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce infectious complications, but growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimicrobial stewardship urgently require approaches to reduce antibiotic use. A recent review estimated close to 5 million deaths were attributed to AMR in 2019, with *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* being the most common associated pathogens, frequently linked to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and postbiopsy infections.",
        "While both transrectal (TR) and transperineal (TP) prostate biopsies offer similar diagnostic power for cancer, the TP approach is associated with significantly fewer infectious complications, including a reported 77% lower risk of hospitalization, and safely allows antibiotic prophylaxis omission, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship and European Association of Urology recommendations. In contrast, TR biopsies, though less resource-intensive and potentially causing less patient discomfort, require antibiotic prophylaxis and carry a higher risk of severe infections.",
        "All included trials used fluoroquinolone-based antibiotic prophylaxis, a practice now critically viewed due to high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), their low threshold for acquiring resistance, and increasing awareness of their side-effect profile among providers and patients. This critical assessment is further underscored by a 2018 European Medicines Agency warning regarding fluoroquinolone side effects, which prompted German authorities to issue warnings and restrict their use.",
        "A systematic review's subgroup analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in overall infectious complications or hospitalizations for transperineal (TP) biopsies performed with or without antibiotic prophylaxis. This supports the conclusion that it may be considered safe to forgo antibiotic prophylaxis in TP biopsies for patients without risk factors, a finding corroborated by randomized data.",
        "Urology association guidelines, particularly from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), currently provide conflicting recommendations on the optimal prostate biopsy approach; the EAU strongly recommends the transperineal (TP) method due to its reduced incidence of infectious complications [12].",
        "This study provides high-level evidence that the transperineal (TP) biopsy route significantly reduces the risk of hospitalisation due to infectious complications compared with the transrectal route, highlighting the need for clear international guidance on biopsy routes and infection risk, grounded in robust evidence, to support consistent and safe clinical practice across regions.",
        "The transperineal (TP) approach appears to have fewer infectious complications, and data suggest it may reduce infection-related morbidity and antibiotic use. Furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis is felt to have limited additional value in a TP biopsy, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles; however, further studies are needed to confirm these findings in broader populations and across healthcare systems.",
        "It may be prudent for further trials and practicing urologists to continue practicing transperineal or transrectal prostate biopsy, with transrectal procedures requiring the use of rectal cleansing or rectal culture-based antibiotics.",
        "Due to rising antimicrobial resistance, including fluoroquinolone resistance as high as 45% [35,37], rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces infectious complications compared to empirical antibiotics, which are the least effective measure. However, studies show variations in the choice, dosage, and duration of antibiotics, rectal cleansing agents, and rectal culture methodology.",
        "While guidelines recommend transperineal prostate biopsy, it is unclear if it's more effective than modified transrectal biopsy (with rectal cleansing or culture-based prophylaxis) in preventing infectious complications, as these modifications significantly reduce risks and are considered acceptable alternatives. Although NMA results suggest rectal cleansing is the most effective strategy overall, followed by rectal culture-guided prophylaxis and then transperineal biopsy, absolute infection rates are lower with transperineal biopsy, and further direct RCTs are needed due to the indirect nature of current comparisons."

A binational registry [24] indicated slower TP adoption among men from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those in regional or low-volume hospitals; while the socioeconomic gap in uptake has narrowed, disparities have grown for patients in outer regional areas compared to major cities and in public versus private hospitals.",
                "In the PREVENT randomized trial, where TP biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to TR biopsy using targeted prophylaxis, the TR approach involved a pre-biopsy rectal swab to screen for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms. Based on culture and sensitivity results, targeted antibiotics were administered; fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was provided if no resistance was detected, or an alternative antibiotic was used for allergic patients or those with resistant strains based on identified sensitivities.",
                "EAU guidelines strongly favor transperineal biopsy (TPB) over transrectal biopsy (TRB) due to a lower risk of infectious complications. This choice is further supported in settings with microbiological resistance concerns and resource limitations, as TRB requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and still reports ~5% infection rates, while TPB allows for PAP omission without increasing infectious complications, aligning with antibiotic stewardship and mitigating resistance where targeted prophylaxis for TRB may not be feasible.",

                "Transrectal biopsy should be abandoned due to its inherently higher infection rate (1.4% even with prophylaxis), which stems from passing through areas heavily colonized by intestinal bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterococci, and other Enterobacterales, and is exacerbated by rising bacterial resistance and risk factors such as MRGN colonization. It should be replaced by the transperineal approach, a sensible alternative with a significantly lower infection rate (0%), comparable tumor detection, and the ability to be performed without prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with Antibiotic Stewardship principles.",
                "The PREVENT trial [12] showed that transperineal (TP) biopsies without preventative antibiotics had no significant infectious complications (0 out of 372 cases), similar to transrectal (TR) biopsies using targeted prophylaxis which had a 1.6% incidence (6 out of 370 cases) of febrile but nonsevere infections, a difference of -1% (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01). The ProBE-PC study [13] observed that TR procedures employed 1-day antibiotic prophylaxis (without rectal cultures), while TP procedures did so only occasionally.",

This choice is particularly relevant given the projected doubling of global prostate cancer incidence by 2040 and the questionable feasibility of routinely implementing rectal cultures for targeted PAP in TRB."

While cephalosporins or aminoglycosides can be used as alternatives with comparable infectious complications where FQs are suspended (2 RCTs), the applicability of targeted prophylaxis to non-FQ antibiotics is unclear, with no RCTs available for non-FQ targeted prophylaxis; consequently, specific agent recommendations are not made due to global variations in pathogens, susceptibility, and antibiotic availability.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Lower Infection, Supports Antibiotic Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Taking into account the feasibility of TP and TR biopsies under local anaesthesia, comparable csPCa detection rates, and the growing importance of antibiotic stewardship, the transperineal biopsy route is preferred over the transrectal route despite potential logistical challenges.

Nugget	In the PREVENT randomized trial [12], TP biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to TR biopsy using targeted prophylaxis. For the TR approach, a pre-biopsy rectal swab screened for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, and based on culture and sensitivity results, targeted antibiotics were administered; fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was given if no resistance was detected, while allergic or resistant cases received an alternative antibiotic based on identified sensitivities.

Nugget	Data substantiate the safety and effectiveness of performing Transperineal Biopsy (TPBx) without antibiotic prophylaxis in 98.9% of cases, as confirmed by two RCTs. This approach directly supports antibiotic stewardship by reducing antibiotic overuse and curbing microbial resistance, global health challenges, while ensuring patient safety and preserving diagnostic precision by mitigating infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains.

Nugget	TP biopsy is associated with a lower admission risk due to postprocedural infection compared with TR biopsy and appears to be a safe procedure without antibiotics in patients without risk factors, advocating for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in urology. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	While a transperineal (TP) biopsy may reduce infection-related morbidity and antibiotic use, and some studies in selected low-risk patients reported no increase in infections without antibiotics, further adequately powered research is needed across broader populations and healthcare systems, using standardized infectious outcome definitions, before changing routine practice. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transperineal (TP) biopsy is associated with a lower admission risk due to postprocedural infection compared to transrectal (TR) biopsy (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.55); the overall difference between methods is statistically significant (p=0.005) with an RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.90) favoring TP. While all TR biopsies utilized antibiotic prophylaxis, there was no statistically significant difference in infectious complications after TP biopsy with or without antibiotics.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Lower Infection Risk Than Transrectal Approach	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	An updated meta-analysis of eleven randomized studies involving 3,306 patients revealed significantly higher infectious complications following transrectal biopsy (64 events among 1,638 men) compared to transperineal biopsy (32 events among 1,668 men), with a relative risk of 1.85 (95% CIs 1.07 to 3.19). This is further supported by a systematic review reporting sepsis rates of 0.9% for transrectal versus 0.1% for transperineal biopsies and a population-based study showing higher re-admission rates for sepsis (1.4% vs 1.0%, respectively), establishing transperineal as the 1st choice and transrectal as the 2nd.

Nugget	The transperineal (TP) approach is primarily used not to reduce mild infections, but because numerous prospective and retrospective reviews demonstrate an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis. Although sepsis is a relatively rare event, the TP approach offers advantages over the transrectal (TR) method, which typically requires more comprehensive antibiotic protocols; for instance, the PREVENT trial reported no infections in 372 TP cases compared to six in 370 TR cases (difference of -1%, 95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01). (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	An overall common effect model revealed a significant difference (z = −3.36; p < 0.001) in the likelihood of admission for infectious complications, with the transperineal (TP) approach demonstrating 77% lower odds of admission (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54) compared to the transrectal (TR) route. Supported by seven studies, the absolute hospitalization risks were 0.026% for TP versus 1.47% for TR; overall sepsis rates were low (TR: 3, TP: 1) and no mortality was reported.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: TRUS Complications vs. Transperineal Practicality	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Prostate cancer diagnosis has traditionally used transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, but local anaesthetic transperineal (LATP) biopsy is gaining popularity due to concerns about TRUS infectious complications (accelerated by COVID-19) and LATP's perceived superior targeting, particularly for anterior and apical lesions. A randomized TRANSLATE trial found LATP led to greater detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer than TRUS in biopsy-naive individuals, providing crucial evidence to inform stakeholders about the trade-offs between these methods.

Nugget	TRUS-PB remains the most commonly used and gold standard method for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, despite being a diagnostic method with high morbidity where complications can range from asymptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI) to sepsis and even death. (Confidence: 100.0%)	RandomizedTrial4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB) is associated with worrying complications including infection, hospitalization, and sepsis, which can make patients reluctant to undergo repeat biopsies and results in significantly higher hospitalization rates. In contrast, the transperineal method has a lower incidence of infection, with no hospitalizations observed in one study of 245 patients. (Confidence: 100.0%)	RandomizedTrial4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Despite EAU guidelines recommending transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TPUS-PB) for its lower infection rate, transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-PB) remains widely used and plays an important role in real-world practice, mainly due to TPUS-PB's complex technical demands and higher patient discomfort, while TRUS is also the least costly option. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview1.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB) remains widely used for diagnosing prostate cancer due to its lower cost, simplicity, and widespread availability, and because the guideline-recommended transperineal approach (TPUS-PB) has greater patient discomfort and complex technical demands, despite TPUS-PB allowing antibiotic prophylaxis omission. While TRUS-PB is associated with significant infectious complications, these can be halved by using culture-guided antibiotics.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Limited Need for Antibiotic Prophylaxis	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	TRANSLATE recruitment centers in this UK study did not use enhanced or rectal culture-guided prophylaxis, including targeted antibiotic prophylaxis with pre-procedure rectal swabs, as these are not routinely practiced in the UK but might be in other countries. The study recognized that excluding participants at higher infection risk, necessary for successful randomisation, likely reduced the infection event rate in both groups, with the infection rate for the modified intention-to-treat population available in Table 4. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The PREVENT trial found no infections in 372 transperineal (TP) cases, versus six (1.6%) febrile but nonsevere infections in 370 transrectal (TR) cases, showing a -1% difference (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p=0.01). Notably, TP biopsies without preventative antibiotics and TR biopsies with targeted antibiotic prophylaxis both showed no significant infectious complications, although the ProBE-PC study reported that all TR procedures used 1-day antibiotic prophylaxis without rectal cultures, unlike TP. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	A systematic review, including a subgroup analysis of ten studies and randomized data such as the NORAPP trial, found no statistically significant difference in overall infectious complications, hospitalizations, or febrile infectious outcomes (p=0.47) when comparing transperineal (TP) biopsies performed with and without antibiotic prophylaxis. Therefore, for patients without risk factors, it may be considered safe to forgo antibiotic prophylaxis in TP biopsies, a conclusion consistent with and extending existing evidence. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Antibiotic prophylaxis has limited additional value in transperineal (TP) biopsies, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles; in contrast, other procedures are less resource intensive but require antibiotic prophylaxis and raise concerns of a higher risk of severe infections.

Cluster	Urology Guidelines Drive Transperineal Biopsy for Antibiotic Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The transrectal approach is noted to contravene antibiotic stewardship principles, a central focus of the 2024 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on urological infections. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, emphasizing antimicrobial stewardship to minimize antibiotic use and combat the escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance through specific guidance on antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration, while acknowledging weak evidence for prophylaxis in some procedures like prostatectomy. (Confidence: 100.0%)	EAU-Guideline_Urological_Infections_Paper.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Both biopsy approaches demonstrate low overall toxicity, are generally safe for clinical use in the populations studied, and the transperineal (TP) approach does not carry an increasing risk of urinary retention. While there is a clear trend across studies to minimize antibiotic use to reduce antibiotic resistance, recent European Association of Urology guidelines specifically direct urologists towards the TP approach. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines maintain a neutral position on both transrectal and transperineal approaches due to a lack of comparative RCTs on infection rates, also stating that the value of prophylactic antibiotics in TPBx is unknown and its wider implementation requires adequate training and resources. Meanwhile, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines describe growing evidence suggesting antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for TPBx, but the panel awaits ongoing RCT findings, mindful that unnecessary prophylactic antibiotic administration can lead to antibiotic resistance across the medical system. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview3.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The exclusive adoption of transperineal (TP) biopsies reduces antibiotic usage by decreasing infectious complications and safely omitting periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis. This is a crucial point for the urological community's debate on optimal biopsy approaches, given the significant implications of antibiotic overuse and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for individual patients, the general population, and their microbiome.

Nugget	Mechanical cleaning methods with saline are cheap, easy to apply, and have no side effects, protecting against possible infections like other antiseptic solutions with similar results for general complications, fever, acute prostatitis, and sepsis, and serving as an alternative for patients with antiseptic allergies. (Confidence: 100.0%)	RandomizedTrial4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Given increasing infection rates and antibiotic resistance, particularly to commonly used quinolones, rectal cleansing with povidone-iodine combined with antibiotic prophylaxis during transrectal biopsy has been shown to reduce infectious complications.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Lower Infection Risk, Guiding Practice	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The EAU strongly recommends the Transperineal (TP) approach due to its reduced incidence of infectious complications, while the AUA, citing limited RCT data, offers unclear guidance but considers both TP and Transrectal (TR) approaches safe and appropriate diagnostic procedures. Although both approaches provide similar diagnostic power, infectious complications appear to favor TP, thus future research must be adequately powered and follow standardized definitions for infectious outcomes. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	High-level evidence confirms that the transperineal (TP) biopsy route significantly reduces the risk of infectious complications requiring hospitalisation compared to the transrectal route. Hospitalisation serves as the most sensitive surrogate for serious infections (not meeting sepsis criteria), reflecting increased severity of complications and a higher risk of sepsis; furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis offers no additional benefit in a TP biopsy, reinforcing antimicrobial stewardship principles. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Clear international guidance on biopsy routes and infection risk, grounded in robust evidence, is needed to support consistent and safe clinical practice across regions.

Nugget	There was a significant association between biopsy approaches and fever, with fever occurring more frequently after TR biopsies, while the TP route showed less frequent postinterventional fever (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89). Furthermore, the TP route significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for infectious complications by 77% compared to the TR route (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54), with no statistically significant difference in infectious complications for TP biopsies whether antibiotics were used or not, unlike TR biopsies which universally utilized antibiotic prophylaxis.

Nugget	For transrectal prostate biopsy, moderate evidence from numerous low-to-moderate quality studies and four meta-analyses suggests that targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) guided by pre-procedural rectal swab results, coupled with Povidone-iodine rectal disinfection to minimize bacterial load, is suitable for reducing postoperative infectious complications. While one meta-analysis (Jazayeri et al. 2020) reported a lower but non-significant infection rate with targeted PAP, its authors still concluded its suitability; conversely, two recent RCTs (Jacewicz 2022; Chernyscheva 2021) found no higher rates of infection, fever, or sepsis when PAP was omitted.

Cluster	Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: Lower Infection, Less Antibiotics	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The transperineal approach is recommended for prostate biopsy due to its lower risk of infectious complications and better antibiotic stewardship. While emerging evidence suggests antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy, a panel is awaiting further RCT findings for a formal recommendation, given that all prostate biopsy recommendations require level 1a evidence.

Nugget	While guidelines now recommend transperineal (TPB) over transrectal (TRB) prostate biopsy, and empirical antibiotics alone are not recommended for TRB, there is insufficient evidence to abandon TRB when combined with rectal cleansing and culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis. These modifications significantly reduce infectious complications, potentially comparable to or even better than TPB, but direct comparisons are scarce, necessitating further RCTs to determine the safest approach.

Nugget	Our trial, which focused on patients with low infectious risk (373 finished out of 403 enrolled before early termination on April 8, 2024), implicated that screening with selective media before TRPB may provide additive value to preventing post-biopsy prostatitis. Piperacillin/tazobactam can be recommended when FQ-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli is detected, while further evaluation of selective media screening is needed for patients with underlying conditions negatively impacting immune function.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: Infection Risk, Prophylaxis, and Methods	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	While transrectal prostate biopsy, even with preoperative rectal screening for multi-drug resistant organisms and targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (t-PAP) reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use by over 80% (favorable for antibiotic stewardship), still carries inherently higher infection rates (5-7%) and a sepsis risk (0.3-9.4%), the transperineal approach offers a superior alternative. Transperineal biopsy, with comparable tumor detection and a significantly lower infection rate (0% even without prophylaxis versus 1.4% for transrectal with PAP), can often entirely forgo antibiotic prophylaxis, thereby aligning more strongly with antibiotic stewardship principles, provided thorough perineal disinfection and urinary tract infection exclusion are performed. (Confidence: 100.0%)	LeitliniePAP2024.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for transrectal prostate biopsy, involving targeted prophylaxis based on rectal or stool culture, augmented prophylaxis with two or more antibiotic classes, or alternative antibiotics such as cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefixime) and aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, amikacin). However, while fosfomycin trometamol (e.g., 3g before and 3g 24-48h after biopsy) is listed as an alternative, its indication for prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany due to manufacturers' failure to submit necessary pharmacokinetic data, requiring urologists to check local guidance regarding its use.

Nugget	The study aimed to assess the efficacy of targeted prophylactic antibiotics (TPAs), based on rectal swabs, in reducing infectious complications after TRUS-PB compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics. This follows a previous meta-analysis [6] which showed that combining prophylactic antibiotics with povidone-iodine rectal preparation before TRUS-PB significantly reduces the incidence of febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) compared to empiric prophylactic antibiotic monotherapy (RR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.3-0.75, p = 0.001).

Cluster	LATP vs TRUS Biopsy: Infection Rates and Outcomes	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	LATP biopsy, performed with chlorhexidine-based skin preparation, typically did not involve antibiotics for most participants (503 [89%] of 567) according to protocol, whereas all participants in the TRUS group received antibiotics. However, participants more commonly reported pain and embarrassment immediately after LATP biopsy. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Concerns over infectious complications, including post-biopsy urinary sepsis, have driven the transition from TRUS to LATP. While recent randomized controlled trials comparing these approaches have reported inconclusive findings for cancer detection and infection rates—potentially due to trial designs, inadequate power, and low event rates—LATP showed fewer infections requiring hospital admission in the first 7 days (one [<1%] of 562 versus seven [1%] of 564 for TRUS) and fewer overall infectious complications in the 4-month post-biopsy period (six [1%] of 562 versus 13 [2%] of 564 for TRUS).

Cluster	Transrectal Biopsy: Infection Risks, Complications, and Costs	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Despite lower upfront procedural costs, the TR-Tbx approach may incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges due to the necessity of preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis. The TR approach also has a higher chance of infection, up to 5-7% [22] in real-world data, due to rectal mucosa involvement, typically requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols.

Nugget	TP-Tbx and TR-Tbx show similar results in detecting PCa, with comparable rates of infection, urinary retention, and effectiveness in managing biopsy-associated pain; however, TP-Tbx can safely omit antibiotics without increasing infection risk, unlike TR-Tbx, which aligns with antibiotic stewardship goals. Despite no clear overall advantage of TP-Tbx in current evidence, preliminary, non-statistically significant findings suggest it may result in lower sepsis rates, with the directionality in key outcomes (infection and sepsis) favoring the TP approach and warranting further investigation, which indicates the tendency to exclude TR-Tbx with prophylactic antibiotics could be moderated. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	TP-Tbx could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with antibiotic stewardship goals and reducing reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are important factors in selecting the optimal biopsy technique.

(Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	A meta-analysis reaffirmed no clear superiority of the transperineal (TP-Tbx) over the transrectal (TR-Tbx) approach for infection prevention or overall cancer detection, with both demonstrating similar efficacy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and diagnostic utility. Although high-quality evidence within the study specifically favored TP for prostate cancer detection, the overall findings suggest that excluding TR from current practices may be moderated, despite international guidelines favoring TP.

Nugget	Rectal cleansing appears to be the most effective strategy for preventing infectious complications, potentially comparable to or better than transperineal biopsy; however, many comparisons are indirect and recent trials show no significant difference between transrectal and transperineal approaches. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to abandon transrectal biopsy, particularly when combined with pre-procedural rectal cleansing or culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis, and further direct RCTs are needed to determine the safest approach.

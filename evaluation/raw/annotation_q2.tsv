Question	How should urologists interpret the evolving divergence between European and national guideline recommendations regarding the preferred biopsy route, given that the transperineal approach shows superior infection control while the transrectal route remains more widespread and logistically simpler in many clinical settings?	-	-	-
				
Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Infection Control and Prophylaxis Evolution	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Urological surgeons must prioritize a vigilant aseptic environment through proper instrument cleaning, operating room protocols, and meticulous disinfection. They should also establish written local guidelines based on knowledge of local pathogen prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence, incorporating strategies such as targeted, augmented, or alternative antibiotic prophylaxis. (Confidence: 100.0%)	EAU-Guideline_Urological_Infections_Paper.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transrectal biopsies require antibiotic prophylaxis to significantly reduce infection rates (RR 0.56), particularly for high-risk patients, whereas transperineal biopsies can generally forgo prophylaxis without increasing infection rates (0.05% vs. 0.08%) if no infection or prostatitis is present, leading to its increased preference in European guidelines. Urologists should individually discuss these infection-related factors, along with pain management and procedure duration, to select the optimal biopsy method for each patient.

Nugget	The EAU guidelines on urological infections note growing evidence suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy (TPBx), a concept reinforced by Jacewicz et al.'s findings that TPBx without prophylaxis significantly lowers infectious complications and strengthens its potential to mitigate infection risk. However, the EAU Panel is awaiting the results of ongoing RCTs before issuing a definitive recommendation. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview3.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The American Urological Association guidelines acknowledge the advantages of both biopsy approaches but maintain a neutral position due to a lack of RCTs comparing infection rates and uncertainty regarding prophylactic antibiotics for transperineal biopsy (TPBx), noting that wider implementation requires adequate training and resources. This is pertinent as a survey of US and European trainees showed less than half were exposed to TPBx and only 29% were comfortable performing it independently, leading to a suggestion that incorporating minimum TPBx cases into training requirements could enhance familiarity and adherence. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview3.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	High-level evidence confirms transperineal (TP) biopsy significantly reduces hospitalization from infectious complications compared to transrectal (TR) biopsy and requires no antibiotic prophylaxis, reinforcing antimicrobial stewardship. These findings address inconsistencies in urological guidelines by supporting the European Association of Urology's recommendation of TP as the preferred approach, which is crucial for the urological community in reducing antibiotic overuse and the burden of antimicrobial resistance. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Urologists should interpret the evolving guideline divergence as a strong shift towards abandoning the transrectal biopsy route due to its fundamentally higher infection rate and the withdrawal of key antibiotics like fluoroquinolones (EMA, March 2019) and fosfomycin-trometamol for prophylaxis. Instead, the transperineal approach is favored for its superior infection control, often allowing routine antibiotic prophylaxis omission if a preoperative UTI is ruled out and thorough perineal disinfection is performed, reflecting prioritizing infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship, while still requiring thorough preoperative assessment of patient risk factors and local resistance patterns.

Cluster	TREXIT: Shifting to Safer Prostate Biopsy Techniques	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	"Prostate biopsies are performed via transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) routes. While the TR approach is associated with significant infectious complications (a major healthcare problem) and potential difficulty accessing the anterior gland and apex, recent trials have debated the difference in infectious complications between routes; despite this, a paradigm shift away from TR biopsies, known as ""TREXIT"" (transrectal biopsy with empirical antibiotic prophylaxis therapy) in the UK, is occurring in some countries.

Nugget	"Although transperineal biopsy (TPBx) was initially performed (e.g., in 1922), transrectal biopsy (TRBx) became the standard in the 1980s due to prostate ultrasound making the procedure easier, yet TPBx use is increasing again. While TRBx is still asserted to be easy, effective, and safe, TPBx completely avoids infectious complications, such as seeding bacteria from the rectum, by not passing through the rectal mucosa; this deviation from transrectal practices, termed ""TRexit,"" aims to mitigate infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains while preserving diagnostic precision. (Confidence: 100.0%)"	SystematicReview3.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Prostate biopsies, a key step in prostate cancer diagnosis, can be performed via transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) routes; the TP approach generally causes fewer infectious complications, allowing safe omission of periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas TR biopsies are postulated to cause less discomfort and be less resource-intensive but require antibiotic prophylaxis and carry a higher risk of severe infections. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	An updated meta-analysis of ten RCTs comparing transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) prostate biopsy approaches found that TP is associated with lower rates of infectious complications, including fever and hospitalization, with seven studies specifically reporting a 77% lower risk of hospitalization for infectious complications with TP compared to TR. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Literature reports transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) infection rates of 0.4-7%, including severe infections requiring hospitalization, sepsis (1-3%), and deaths (0.1-1.3%) [Stangl-Kremser 2023, Fontana 2018]. In contrast, one study population experienced no sepsis or severe urinary tract infections within two months post-biopsy, with ambulatory UTIs occurring at 0.36% (one patient) and 1.09% (three patients). (Confidence: 80.0%)	LeitliniePAP2024.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	While the transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) is currently widely performed, its path through a highly colonized intestinal area leads to a fundamentally higher infection rate with potential pathogens like *E. coli* (e.g., 1.4% compared to 0% for transperineal biopsy (TPB) without prophylaxis in a comparative study). TPB offers a sensible alternative with comparable tumor detection, significantly lower infection risk, feasibility in outpatient and local anesthesia settings, and aligns with antibiotic stewardship due to its potential without routine antibiotic prophylaxis amidst increasing bacterial resistance, thus advocating for TRPB's replacement.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: Antibiotic Prophylaxis and Route Selection	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The transperineal approach is the preferred prostate biopsy route due to a lower risk of infectious complications and better antibiotic stewardship, requiring perineal cleansing and antibiotic prophylaxis. If transperineal biopsy is not feasible, the transrectal route is a second choice, requiring povidone-iodine rectal preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis, with a meta-analysis of 1,753 patients showing significantly reduced infections when using antimicrobial prophylaxis compared to placebo/control [RR (95% CIs) 0.56 (0.40 to 0.77)]; antimicrobial selection for either procedure should be based on local pathogen prevalence, susceptibility, and virulence.

Nugget	Rectal cleansing with povidone-iodine is strongly recommended for men prior to transrectal prostate biopsy. (Confidence: 100.0%)	EAU-Guidelines-on-Urological-infections-2025_2025-05-24-110339_pxmf.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The transrectal prostate biopsy, currently the gold standard for approximately 2 million annual procedures in Europe and USA, necessitates antibiotic prophylaxis but is associated with 0.3-9.4% sepsis and 5-7% infection rates, which are increasing due to antibiotic resistance. In contrast, transperineal prostate biopsy (including MRI-fusion) permits antibiotic prophylaxis omission without raising the risk of urosepsis or severe urinary tract infections, though a consensus on this recommendation is still lacking. (Confidence: 80.0%)	LeitliniePAP2024.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Regarding antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) for transperineal prostate biopsy, there is currently no consensus; the AUA offers no recommendation, while the EAU still recommends it. However, recent evidence challenges this: a 2022 meta-analysis by Castellani et al. (eight comparative studies, four retrospective, four prospective, no RCTs, low evidence certainty) reported infection rates of 0.11% with PAP vs. 0.31% without (p=0.29), and two subsequent RCTs (Jacewicz 2022; Chernyscheva 2021) and a comprehensive 2024 meta-analysis by Wolff et al. (including these RCTs and 21 non-RCTs) further found no higher rates of infection, fever, or sepsis when PAP was omitted.

Cluster	Optimizing Prostate Biopsy Infection Prophylaxis and Techniques	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for transrectal prostate biopsy, with options including targeted or augmented regimens (though augmented contravenes stewardship), or alternative antibiotics such as fosfomycin trometamol (e.g., 3g before and 3g 24-48h after biopsy), cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone 1g i.m.; cefixime 400mg p.o. for 3d), or aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin 3mg/kg i.v.; amikacin 15mg/kg i.m.). Urologists must note that the indication for fosfomycin trometamol for prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany due to a lack of necessary pharmacokinetic data, requiring a check of local guidance for its use. (Confidence: 100.0%)	EAU-Guideline_Urological_Infections_Paper.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	A panel is awaiting ongoing RCT results before making recommendations on growing evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy, as all prostate biopsy recommendations necessitate level 1a evidence. While meta-analyses indicate no difference in infectious complications related to peri-prostatic local anaesthesia, needle guide type, needle type, needle size, or number of peri-prostatic nerve block injections, a minimum one-day administration of fluoroquinolones is recommended where allowed, and augmented prophylaxis (combining two or more antibiotic classes) has been shown to be superior to standard methods for preventing infectious complications.

Nugget	The transperineal approach is recommended for prostate biopsy due to its low risk of infectious complications and better antibiotic stewardship; however, a meta-analysis indicates that infections after transrectal prostate biopsy can be significantly reduced with antimicrobial prophylaxis. Urologists should also note that the indication for fosfomycin trometamol in prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany, and local guidance should be checked regarding its use.

Nugget	Strong recommendations for prostate biopsy include using povidone-iodine rectal cleansing prior to transrectal biopsies, routine surgical skin disinfection for transperineal biopsies, and recognizing the transperineal approach's lower infection risk; these are all strongly rated, despite low certainty data, due to their high clinical benefit, simple application, and/or statistical and clinical significance. Additionally, avoiding fluoroquinolones in prostate biopsy is strongly advised as the European Commission has suspended their use for peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis due to stringent regulatory and legal implications.

Nugget	Drei randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien zeigen vergleichbare Prostatakarzinom-Detektions- und ähnliche Harnverhalt-Raten für transperineale (TP) und transrektale (TR) Biopsien [98, 263, 264]. Während TP-Biopsien signifikant länger dauern (12,7 min vs. 9,2 min; p<0,0001) [266] und unter Lokalanästhesie durchgeführt werden können [265], ermöglichen sie den Verzicht auf Antibiotikaprophylaxe ohne erhöhte Infektionsraten, wie Studien zeigen, die sehr niedrige Infektionsraten auch ohne Prophylaxe bestätigen [170, 171], wohingegen TR-Biopsien von einer Prophylaxe zur Infektionsreduktion signifikant profitieren [169]. (Confidence: 80.0%)	LL_Prostatakarzinom_Langversion_8.0.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Recent RCTs have shown no significant benefit for transperineal (TP) biopsy over transrectal (TR) biopsy, with TP not significantly reducing sepsis compared to TR with empirical antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to abandon TR, especially as modifications like rectal cleansing or culture-based antibiotics for TR can reduce infectious complications comparably to or better than TP, while one trial suggests antibiotics may be avoided completely before TP; however, further RCTs are needed to determine the safest overall approach. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview5.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Subgroup analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in overall infectious complications or hospitalizations when comparing transperineal (TP) biopsies with and without antibiotic prophylaxis. This suggests that for patients without risk factors, it may be considered safe to forgo antibiotic prophylaxis in TP biopsies, an approach supported by randomized data like the NORAPP trial.

Nugget	TP-Tbx could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with effective antibiotic stewardship and reducing reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics, all of which are important factors in choosing the optimal biopsy technique. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	TR-Tbx, despite having lower upfront procedural costs, may incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges due to the necessity of preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	TP-Tbx, traditionally associated with higher costs due to general anesthesia and more complex equipment, has seen these barriers reduced by adapting to local anesthesia, simpler instrumentation, and varied biopsy strategies. In contrast, TR-Tbx, despite lower upfront procedural costs, may incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges from requiring preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: Transperineal vs. Transrectal Recommendations	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Updated guidelines state that image-guided prostate core biopsy can be performed transperineally or transrectally (Rec 4.30). While transrectal biopsy requires antibiotic prophylaxis (Rec 4.32), this can be omitted for transperineal biopsy if no infection or prostatitis is present (Rec 4.35); however, transperineal biopsy is associated with increased pain perception (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.27-2.65, based on a meta-analysis of 3 studies) and a potentially longer intervention duration compared to the transrectal approach. (Confidence: 80.0%)	LL_Prostatakarzinom_Langversion_8.0.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Despite guideline recommendations for transperineal prostate biopsy over transrectal, it remains unclear whether transperineal is more effective than transrectal biopsy when simple modifications like rectal cleansing and rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis are used. These proven and guideline-incorporated strategies reduce infectious complications, potentially offering comparable or even superior infection control to transperineal biopsy. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview5.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	There is insufficient evidence to recommend abandoning transrectal prostate biopsy, so urologists and further trials may continue practicing either transperineal or transrectal biopsy. If the transrectal route is chosen, simple modifications such as rectal cleansing or rectal culture-based antibiotics are prudent, as they reduce infectious complications comparably to or even better than transperineal biopsy, while empirical antibiotics alone are not recommended.

Cluster	TRBx vs. TPBx: Infection Risk and Antibiotic Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Transrectal biopsy (TRBx) inherently carries an infection risk, particularly sepsis, with numerous studies consistently demonstrating it causes a higher incidence of infectious and serious complications like sepsis, substantial bleeding, symptomatic UTIs, and fever compared to transperineal biopsy (TPBx). (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview3.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transperineal (TP-Tbx) and transrectal (TR-Tbx) biopsies yield similar results for PCa detection, urinary retention, and pain. While current evidence indicates generally comparable infection rates and no clear overall advantage for TP-Tbx, it uniquely allows safe antibiotic omission, supporting antibiotic stewardship, and shows a non-statistically significant directional favorability for infections and sepsis. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The tendency to exclude transrectal biopsy (TR-Tbx) with prophylactic antibiotics due to infection concerns could be moderated; however, the directionality of key outcomes like infections and sepsis favors the transperineal (TP) approach despite a lack of statistical significance.

Cluster	Transrectal vs. Transperineal Biopsy Infection Risks	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Infectious complications are significantly higher following transrectal biopsy (64 events among 1,638 men) compared to transperineal biopsy (32 events among 1,668 men), with a reported relative risk of 1.85 (95% CIs 1.07 to 3.19). This is further supported by an eleven-study meta-analysis of 3,306 patients, a systematic review across 165 studies with 162,577 patients showing transrectal sepsis rates of 0.9% versus transperineal 0.1%, and a UK population-based study (n=73,630) that found transrectal sepsis re-admission rates of 1.4% compared to 1.0% for transperineal biopsies.

Nugget	The analysis found no statistically significant association in sepsis incidence between transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) biopsy groups, despite a low overall rate (3 cases in TR, 1 in TP) and no reported mortality. However, all included studies were underpowered to effectively detect sepsis, which, combined with sepsis remaining an isolated incident, may lead to an underestimation of the true risk, particularly for TR biopsies.

Cluster	Optimizing Prostate Biopsy: Routes, Prophylaxis, and Safety	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	An updated meta-analysis of eleven RCTs (2,237 men) found that rectal povidone-iodine preparation before biopsy with antimicrobial prophylaxis significantly lowered infectious complications (RR 0.47), outperforming after-biopsy application; however, rectal enema preparation before transrectal biopsy showed no significant advantage (4 RCTs, 671 men). While routine surgical disinfection of the perineal skin before transperineal biopsy is recommended despite single RCTs showing no benefit, and extended biopsy templates had comparable complications to standard templates (10 RCTs, 2,342 patients), routine general use should be critically assessed due to infectious complications reported in non-randomized studies.

Nugget	Historically, the transrectal (TR) approach was favored for its less invasive nature, ease of use, quick execution, and the absence of a need for general anesthesia. The decision regarding biopsy route is also influenced by factors such as diagnostic accuracy, procedural safety, patient comfort, instrument availability, and procedure-related costs and time.

Nugget	Antibiotic prophylaxis in transperineal (TP) biopsies is considered to have limited additional value, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles. A subgroup analysis of ten studies (comparing 741 TP biopsies with antibiotics to 1361 without) found no statistically significant difference in febrile infectious outcomes between antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches (p = 0.47). (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	While traditional biopsies employ antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce infectious complications, the transperineal (TP) approach generally causes fewer infections and allows for the safe omission of periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis, thus significantly reducing antibiotic usage and burden.

Cluster	Optimizing Prostate Biopsy Safety and Antibiotic Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Biopsy-related complications (infection, hospitalization, sepsis) are concerning, with transrectal biopsy having significantly higher rates of sepsis-related hospitalization compared to transperineal biopsy, which saw no hospitalizations in one study of 245 patients and only 5 out of 6609 patients hospitalized for sepsis in a 16-article review. To mitigate this, current urology guidelines recommend povidone-iodine rectal cleaning alongside antibiotic prophylaxis before biopsy if local infectious complication rates are high, as antiseptic rectal cleaning is a validated method for reducing complications.

Nugget	The TRANSLATE study demonstrated fewer infections and post-biopsy infection hospitalizations following transperineal (LATP) versus transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsies, although the difference in overall infections was not statistically significant. Critically for antibiotic stewardship, 89% of LATP biopsies in TRANSLATE were safely performed without antibiotics (with 11% receiving them largely due to protocol deviations), which occurred in centres not routinely using enhanced or rectal culture-guided prophylaxis, consistent with UK practice.

Cluster	Biopsy Approaches: Infection Risk and Antibiotic Use Differences.	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The transperineal (TP) approach is primarily chosen because numerous prospective and retrospective reviews demonstrate an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis, rather than just reducing mild infections. Conversely, the transrectal (TR) approach has a higher real-world infection rate of up to 5-7% due to rectal mucosa involvement, requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols that conflict with efforts to minimize antibiotic resistance; however, sepsis itself is a much rarer complication, with no cases reported in the ProBE-PC study for either approach.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: EAU Recommends TP for Reduced Infection	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	In recent years, European Association of Urology guidelines have directed urologists toward using the transperineal (TP) approach, without an increasing risk of urinary retention; despite this recommendation, the choice between the transrectal (TR) and TP biopsy techniques remains a topic of debate. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	While the American Urological Association (AUA) deems both transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) biopsy approaches safe and appropriate, the European Association of Urology (EAU) strongly recommends TP due to significantly reduced infectious complications. The TP approach demonstrably lowers the absolute risk of hospitalization for infection (0.026% vs 1.47% for TR), reducing admission odds by 77% (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54), and also shows lower rates of fever (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.90), despite both methods offering similar diagnostic power.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy Comparison: Efficacy, Safety, and Cost	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The transrectal approach (TRUS-PB) is widely recommended and used, mainly owing to the transperineal approach's (TPUS-PB) complex technical demands and higher patient discomfort, with TRUS ($1869) being the least costly. Consequently, TRUS-PB continues to play an important role in real-world practice despite the theoretical advantages of TPUS-PB and MRI-guided techniques.

Cluster	Omitting Antibiotics for Transperineal Biopsy	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Transrectal biopsy (TRB) requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and reports ~5% infectious complications, while transperineal biopsy (TPB) rarely causes infectious complications, which PAP does not further reduce. Therefore, omitting PAP in TPB is advisable based on a systematic review, and despite this recommendation having (very) low certainty due to limited RCTs, consistent results suggest negligible patient risk, further benefiting patients by avoiding microbiome disruption and mitigating antibiotic resistance. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	High-level evidence confirms the transperineal (TP) biopsy route significantly reduces hospitalization risk from infectious complications compared to the transrectal (TR) route, which consistently utilizes antibiotic prophylaxis. The TP method may reduce overall infection-related morbidity and antibiotic use, and some studies suggest it can be performed without antibiotics in low-risk patients; however, further robust research in broader populations and clear international guidance are needed to standardize consistent, safe practice.

Nugget	From pragmatic and forward-looking perspectives, the transperineal biopsy approach, which current studies suggest does not require PAP, should be favored over the transrectal approach, which will always necessitate PAP [20]. This is particularly noteworthy for prostate biopsy, as the global incidence of prostate cancer and consequently the frequency of histological confirmations through biopsy are projected to double by 2040 [19].

Concurrently, digital rectal examination (DRE) is significantly inferior to PSA, detecting only about 14% of PSA-identified tumors and lacking scientific evidence despite its historical inclusion, while prostate MRI in primary diagnostics is strengthened and recommended before biopsy after a confirmed PSA >3 ng/ml if actionable, and genetic counseling is advised for metastatic disease or familial tumor risk syndromes.

Cluster	Transperineal vs. Transrectal Biopsy: Risks, Benefits, Patient Impact	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	While transperineal (LATP) biopsy shows fewer infectious complications (1% vs 2% for TRUS) and numerically fewer serious adverse events (2% vs 4% for TRUS, though not statistically significant), it is also more commonly reported as immediately painful and embarrassing (38% vs 27%) despite leading to more adequate sampling, while TRUS has higher procedure-related symptoms at 7 days.

Cluster	LATP Biopsy: Fewer Infections, Longer Procedure Time	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	LATP resulted in significantly fewer biopsy-related hospitalizations for infection, with 1 (<1%) of 562 at 7 days and 2 (<1%) of 562 at 35 days, compared to TRUS, which had 7 (1%) of 564 at 7 days and 9 (2%) of 564 at 35 days. This superior infection control, observed even though 89% of LATP procedures were performed without antibiotics (using chlorhexidine skin preparation) while all TRUS procedures involved pre/post-procedure antibiotics, is a key factor driving the transition to LATP due to concerns about post-biopsy urinary sepsis and other infectious complications.

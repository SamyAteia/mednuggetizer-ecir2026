Cluster	LATP Biopsy: Less Antibiotics, Fewer Infections	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	LATP biopsy was performed with chlorhexidine-based skin preparation and without antibiotics; 503 (89%) of 567 participants who received LATP underwent biopsy without antibiotics according to protocol. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Using the primary definition of post-biopsy infection (requiring hospital admission), LATP resulted in lower rates compared to TRUS biopsy: one (<1%) of 562 vs. seven (1%) of 564 within 7 days (OR 0.14 [95% CI 0.02-1-15]), and 2 (<1%) vs. 9 (2%) within 35 days, with both 7-day and 35-day hospitalizations likely related to biopsy. For the secondary, broader definition of infection (symptoms or signs with or without admission), no statistically significant difference was observed over 4 months between LATP (113 [20%] of 562) and TRUS (120 [21%] of 564). (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Concerns about infectious complications and the development of post-biopsy urinary sepsis have driven the transition from TRUS to LATP, with LATP showing fewer overall infectious complications (six [1%] of 562) compared to TRUS (13 [2%] of 564) in the 4-month post-biopsy period (adjusted 0.45 [0.17-1.20]). (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The TRANSLATE study demonstrated that most LATP biopsies can be safely performed without antibiotics, with 89% of cases not receiving them (11% were largely protocol deviations), resulting in fewer infections (both resulting and not resulting in hospital admission) compared to TRUS. This finding, important for antibiotic stewardship, should be considered with the caveat that the infection difference was not statistically significant as it was a secondary outcome for which the trial was not powered. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	TP-Tbx can safely omit antibiotics without increasing infection risk, unlike TR-Tbx; however, a meta-analysis reaffirms no clear superiority of the TP-Tbx approach over the TR-Tbx approach in terms of infection prevention and cancer detection.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Antibiotic Prophylaxis Guidelines Evolving	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	A growing body of evidence suggests antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy; however, the Panel is waiting for ongoing RCTs to report their findings before making a recommendation, as all prostate biopsy recommendations are based on level 1a evidence.

Nugget	The indication for fosfomycin trometamol for prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany because manufacturers did not submit the necessary pharmacokinetic data. Urologists are advised to check their local guidance regarding its use. (Confidence: 80.0%)	EAU-Guideline_Urological_Infections_Paper.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transperineal biopsies are considered an optimization of antibiotic stewardship, with other strategies including rectal cleansing, rectal swab culture with targeted antibiotics, or avoiding any antibiotics prior to the biopsy. Relevant studies are RCTs involving adults aged 18 or older undergoing transrectal or transperineal prostate biopsy (not aspiration, eight or more cores), comparing standard empirical antibiotic prophylaxis or alternative prophylactic interventions, such as the NORAPP trial on antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis in transperineal prostate biopsies. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview5.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Presented data, including a meta-analysis, substantiate the safety and effectiveness of not administering antibiotic prophylaxis during transperineal prostate biopsy (TPBx), which supports antibiotic stewardship, curbs microbial resistance, and guarantees patient safety. While EAU guidelines describe growing evidence for this approach, they are currently waiting for findings from ongoing randomized controlled trials.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: No Infection Benefit from Antibiotic Prophylaxis	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Study inclusion criteria for prostate biopsy patients encompassed elevated/rising PSA, suspicious digital-rectal exam, active surveillance, and suspected recurrence after radiation or HIFU. While low CD4+ helper cell counts are associated with increased postoperative wound infection risk, no specific periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) studies were found for patients with HIV-associated immunodeficiency, neutropenia, or those on immunosuppressive medication; however, expert opinion suggests that PAP principles for these immunocompromised subgroups align with those for non-immunocompromised patients.

Nugget	A Castellani et al. (2022) meta-analysis, based on low certainty evidence from 8 non-RCT comparative studies on perineal prostate biopsy, reported infection rates of 0.11% with periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) versus 0.31% without PAP (p = 0.29). However, two subsequent RCTs (Jacewicz 2022; Chernyscheva 2021) on transperineal biopsy have since shown no higher rates of infections, fever, or sepsis when PAP is omitted. (Confidence: 80.0%)	LeitliniePAP2024.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Evidence from multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including one of eight non-RCTs and another of 112 patient cohorts, corroborated by two published RCTs, indicates no significant difference in infection rates for transperineal prostate biopsy regardless of antibiotic prophylaxis administration. Reported rates comparing prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis include post-biopsy infection (0.11% vs. 0.31%), post-transperineal-biopsy infection (1.35% of 29,880 patients vs. 1.22% of 4,772 men [p=0.8]), sepsis (0.13% vs. 0.09%), and septic complications (0.05% vs. 0.08% [p=0.2]), suggesting prophylaxis may not be routinely required.

Nugget	Despite the relatively low infection rate following transperineal prostate biopsy (TPB), it remains unresolved whether periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) can be omitted. Studies indicate that omitting PAP does not result in higher infectious complications (such as genitourinary infections, fever, sepsis, readmission, or 30-day mortality), though analyses did not account for patient-level differences like medical comorbidities or prior prostate biopsies, which could contribute to post-procedural infections.

Nugget	Procedure: Transrectal prostate biopsy (Confidence: 80.0%)	EAU-Guideline_Urological_Infections_Paper.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Transrectal prostate biopsy, commonly performed as ultrasound-guided TRUS-PB and considered the most common and gold standard for prostate cancer diagnosis, has significantly higher sepsis rates compared to transperineal biopsy; notably, none of 245 patients who underwent transperineal biopsy were hospitalized. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, performed transrectally (TRUS-PB) or transperineally (TPUS-PB), is the primary diagnostic method for prostate cancer. While TRUS-PB is still widely used, it is associated with a significant rate of infectious complications, whereas the guideline-recommended TPUS-PB allows for the omission of antibiotic prophylaxis while maintaining comparable detection and complication rates.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Prophylaxis & Stewardship	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	A multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolled 403 low-risk patients undergoing transperineal biopsy (TRPB), randomizing them into a cultured group (CG) or a no cultured group (NCG). All participants received levofloxacin (LVFX) antibiotic prophylaxis; for the NCG, this involved 1 dose of LVFX 500 mg orally 2 hours before TRPB, while the CG received rectal culture-based prophylaxis.

Nugget	In the PREVENT randomized trial [12], transperineal (TP) biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to transrectal (TR) biopsy with targeted prophylaxis, while the ProBE-PC study [13] utilized 1-day antibiotic prophylaxis for TR procedures (without rectal cultures) and only occasionally for TP. This highlights TP-Tbx's potential to reduce or eliminate the need for prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with antibiotic stewardship goals and reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic reliance, crucial considerations for biopsy technique selection.

Cluster	Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Regimens, Timing, and Patient Selection	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	In cases of doubt and for high-risk patients, antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered 30 minutes pre-operatively, using Cefuroxime i.m. or i.v., or alternatively Ampicillin/Sulbactam. (Confidence: 80.0%)	LeitliniePAP2024.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Lower Infection, Reduced Antibiotics	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The study recognized that excluding participants at higher risk of infection, necessary for successful randomisation, likely reduced the infection event rate in both groups. Although an observed difference was not statistically significant, this was a secondary outcome and the trial was not powered around it. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Two published RCTs have reported comparably low post-biopsy infection rates for transperineal biopsy regardless of whether antibiotic prophylaxis was administered, contributing to a growing body of evidence suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be routinely required for transperineal biopsy.

Nugget	Transperineal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TPUS-PB) allows for the omission of antibiotic prophylaxis while maintaining comparable detection and complication rates to transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-PB), showing a significantly lower incidence of infectious complications (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.92, p = 0.02) per a meta-analysis of RCTs. The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend TPUS-PB as the first choice due to its lower infection rate; however, for widely used TRUS-PB, transrectal antibiotic prophylaxis (TRAP) based on rectal swab culture should be considered.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: High-Risk Patient Exclusions	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Patients with a history of immunocompromise or a need for enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included previous prostate biopsy, extensive local disease (prostate-specific antigen >50 ng/mL or entire gland replaced by tumour on MRI), symptoms of concurrent or recent urinary tract infection, absent rectum, or inability to position in lithotomy. (Confidence: 80.0%)	RandomizedTrial2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Studies were excluded if patients had a previous prostate surgery, congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, current infections at the time of biopsy, were on long-term immunosuppressive therapy, or received other prophylactic interventions not listed, as these factors might independently affect the risk of infection following a biopsy. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview5.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies (12,324 patients) found no statistically significant differences in pooled incidences of genitourinary infections (0.50% vs 0.37%), fever (0.44% vs 0.26%), sepsis (0.16% vs 0.13%), or readmission rates (0.35% vs 0.29%) following transperineal prostate biopsy with versus without periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (all p > 0.250). However, the study's design did not allow for the evaluation of specific high-risk patient groups such as immunocompromised or catheterized individuals, thus limiting the applicability of these conclusions to those subgroups.

Cluster	Antibiotic-Free Transperineal Biopsy: Safety and Guideline Updates	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Both transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) prostate biopsy approaches generally show low overall toxicity and no significant differences in cancer detection or complications, though their comparative benefits and safety are still debated. However, the MRI-targeted TP approach may be advantageous as it can be performed safely without antibiotics, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines on Prostate Cancer note emerging evidence suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be necessary for transperineal prostate biopsies, though formal recommendations are pending further research.

Cluster	Urological Infection Management: Targeted Screening and Antibiotic Use	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) via pre-operative urine culture is strongly recommended before urological procedures breaching the mucosa, aiming to reduce infectious complications and optimize antimicrobial coverage. This is especially important as ABU is a risk factor for infectious complications (e.g., in nephrostomy/ureteral stent placement), and patients at higher risk for urosepsis include the elderly, diabetics, and immunosuppressed individuals (such as transplant recipients, or those on cancer chemotherapy or corticosteroids).

Cluster	Safe Transperineal Biopsy: No Routine Antibiotics Recommended	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Omitting periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) during transperineal biopsy (TPB) is advisable, as infectious complications are very rare and cannot be further reduced by PAP, supporting antibiotic stewardship and posing negligible risk without compromising safety. However, this recommendation has (very) low certainty due to limitations, including a lack of high-quality studies and insufficient analysis of patient-level differences like comorbidities, suggesting further research is needed to tailor antibiotic stewardship strategies for specific patient subgroups. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview4.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Analysis of 23 studies, encompassing 6520 patients with periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and 5804 without, found that transperineal biopsy (TPB) without PAP resulted in no significantly higher complication rates across all analyzed endpoints in aggregated, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, supporting recommendations to abstain from PAP.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Safe to Omit Antibiotic Prophylaxis	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Current literature [11] suggests that omitting periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis during transperineal (TP) biopsy, which generally causes fewer infectious complications, is safe. A subgroup analysis [Fig. 3] found no statistically significant difference in overall infectious complications or hospitalizations between TP biopsies with and without prophylaxis, concluding it may be safe to forgo prophylaxis for patients without risk factors, an approach supported by randomized data such as the NORAPP trial [18]. (Confidence: 80.0%)	SystematicReview2.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?

Cluster	Transrectal vs. Transperineal Biopsy Infection Safety	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Infection rates were low and similar between transrectal (TR) and transperineal (TP) biopsies, with 28 infections among 1545 patients (TR 2%, TP 2%) and only one sepsis case reported overall (TR 1/762, TP 0/783). The ProBE-PC study showed similarly low infectious complications (TR 2.6%, TP 2.7%), primarily mild fevers, with no sepsis reported, while the PREVENT trial found no infections in 372 TP cases versus six (1.6%) in 370 TR cases. (Confidence: 100.0%)	SystematicReview6.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Preliminary evidence suggests that TP-Tbx may result in lower rates of sepsis, and this directionality for key outcomes like infection and sepsis appears to favor TP-Tbx.

Cluster	Prostate Biopsy: Infection Risks and Evolving Guidelines	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Transperineal prostate biopsies (TPPB) were not performed during the clinical trial, and patients with severe immunodeficiency or indwelling urinary catheters were also excluded. However, current European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines now recommend TPPB because of its lower rate of infectious complications. (Confidence: 100.0%)	RandomizedTrial1.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	Growing evidence indicates that infection, hospitalization, and sepsis rates are comparably lower in transperineal prostate biopsy (TPPB) compared with transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB). For TRPB, antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory to avoid infectious complications and is recommended with povidone-iodine rectal preparation; prior gold standard FQs are no longer accepted in the EU, EAU guidelines recommend an algorithm, and a study found no significant difference between single-dose and prolonged FMT prophylaxis.

Nugget	For transperineal biopsy, periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis can be omitted if no infection or prostatitis is present, as demonstrated by a multicentric study showing no hospitalizations for sepsis or urinary tract infection within two months. However, for patients presenting with risk factors such as immunosuppression, a history of prostatitis/urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus with elevated infection risk, recent antibiotic use, or travel to high antibiotic-resistance regions, a rectal swab for targeted antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Antibiotic Prophylaxis Strategies	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Rectal culture using selective media before transperineal biopsy (TRPB) demonstrated effectiveness in preventing acute, post-biopsy prostatitis, achieving an overall incidence of 1.1% within 30 days, particularly in patients with low infectious risks. These highly accurate selective media (e.g., LVFX-insusceptible, with 98.1% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity) allow for targeted recommendations like TAZ/PIPC when FQ-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli is detected, though further evaluation is needed for patients with higher infectious risks or underlying conditions negatively impacting immune function.

Nugget	A recent trial demonstrated that antibiotic prophylaxis can be completely avoided before transperineal biopsy without significantly increasing infection rates. Specifically, there was no significant difference in sepsis (OR 0.49, p = 0.42) or UTI (OR 0.81, p = 0.7) rates compared to standard prophylaxis, and the risk of fever was lower (OR 0.58, p = 0.088) in the group omitting antibiotics.

Nugget	Transperineal biopsy (TP-Tbx) can safely omit periprocedural antibiotics without increasing infection risk, unlike transrectal biopsy (TR-Tbx) which commonly uses prophylaxis. Both methods demonstrate similar rates of PCa detection, postprocedural infection (OR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8), sepsis, urinary retention, and biopsy-associated pain, though infections and sepsis directionally favor TP despite lacking statistical significance.

Nugget	A systematic literature search identified an RCT (Jacewicz et al. 2022) showing a non-statistically significant reduction in urinary tract infections (UTIs) with periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) versus no PAP (OR 0.33 [0.03-3.19]), with no sepsis or hospitalization-requiring UTIs occurring in either group; however, the evidence for UTIs is rated very low due to bias risks and imprecise estimators, and intestinal colonization with multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria (MRGN) is described as a risk factor. (Confidence: 80.0%)	LeitliniePAP2024.pdf	How relevant ist the nugget to the query?	
Nugget	For transperineal prostate biopsy (including MRI-fusion), antibiotic prophylaxis can be omitted, provided a preoperative urinary tract infection is reliably excluded (e.g., via U-Stix) and the perineum is thoroughly disinfected with Chlorhexidine or Octenidindihydrochlorid/Phenoxyethanol. This omission does not appear to increase the risk of urosepsis or severe urinary tract infections, though less severe UTIs were three times more frequent without prophylaxis (absolute difference 0.73%), with 137 patients requiring antibiotic treatment to prevent one infection.

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Antibiotic Prophylaxis Doesn't Reduce Infection	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including one of eight non-RCTs [613] and another of 112 individual patient cohorts [614], along with two recently published RCTs [615, 616], consistently reported comparably low post-biopsy infection rates for transperineal biopsy whether antibiotic prophylaxis was administered or not. Specifically, the review of eight non-RCTs reported no significant differences in post-biopsy infection (0.11% with vs. 0.31% without prophylaxis) and sepsis (0.13% vs. 0.09%) [613], while the review of 112 cohorts showed infection rates of 1.35% in 29,880 patients with prophylaxis vs. 1.22% in 4,772 patients without (p = 0.8) [614].

Nugget	The document does not explicitly address the omission of periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis during transperineal biopsy or maintaining non-inferior infection rates across different risk categories (e.g., immunocompromised or catheterized patients) for this specific procedure. However, for transrectal prostate biopsy, prophylaxis is recommended, with regimens including targeted prophylaxis (based on rectal swab/stool culture), augmented prophylaxis (two or more antibiotic classes), or alternative antibiotics such as Fosfomycin trometamol, Cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefixime), or Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, amikacin).

Cluster	Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Transperineal vs. Transrectal Biopsy	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Für die transperineale Biopsie kann bei Nicht-Vorhandensein einer Infektion oder Prostatitis auf eine Antibiotikaprophylaxe verzichtet werden. Eine Metaanalyse von 11 Studien mit 1.753 Patienten zeigte hingegen eine signifikante Reduktion von Infektionen durch eine Antibiotikaprophylaxe bei der transrektalen Biopsie (RR 0,56, 95 % KI 0,40-0,77).

Cluster	Transperineal Biopsy: Sepsis Prevention, Reduced Antibiotic Use.	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	Driven by a trend to minimize antibiotic use to reduce resistance [12,13,15], the transperineal (TP) approach is favored over the transrectal (TR) approach—which carries a 5-7% [22] infection risk due to rectal mucosa involvement and typically requires comprehensive antibiotic protocols or prophylaxis—because TP, even though it often requires more extensive preparation and potentially general anesthesia, avoids the rectal mucosa, resulting in an almost complete absence of post-biopsy sepsis. This significant advantage, not primarily due to a reduction in mild infections, is corroborated by numerous prospective and retrospective reviews and trials like PREVENT, which reported zero infections in 372 TP cases versus six in 370 TR cases (difference of -1% [95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p=0.01]), despite sepsis being a rare event that often underpowers studies to detect differences.

Cluster	Biopsy Infection Safety: TP Without Antibiotics, TR With Prophylaxis	-	How consistent/coherent is the cluster?	
Nugget	The PREVENT trial [12] demonstrated that transperineal (TP) biopsies without preventative antibiotics resulted in no reported infections and no significant infectious complications. This outcome is similar to transrectal (TR) biopsies that used targeted antibiotic prophylaxis, where the trial showed a minimal 1.6% infection incidence; these infections were febrile but nonsevere and did not escalate to critical levels.

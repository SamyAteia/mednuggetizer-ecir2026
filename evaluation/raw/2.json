            "this method has increasingly been under investigation due to a higher incidence of infectious complications, which can be severe and may require hospi- talization.",
            "the TP approach, although often requiring more extensive prepa- ration and potentially general anesthesia, significantly miti- gates the risk of infection by avoiding the rectal mucosa, thus offering a potentially safer alternative [5].",
            "Our meta-analysis reaffirms the lack of clear superiority of the TP-Tbx approach over the TR-Tbx approach in terms of infection prevention and cancer detection. This study, solely by high-quality evidence that overcomes retrospective studies' limitations [16], favored the TP approach for the detection of PCa [7,17,18]. Despite international clinical guidelines favoring TP, our findings suggest that excluding TR from current practices may be moderated.",
            "Across three studies [12,13,15], there is a clear trend toward minimizing antibiotic use to reduce antibiotic resistance. The TR approach has a higher chance of infection due to the involvement of the rectal mucosa, according to the real-world data rate of up to 5-7% [22], typically requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols. Thus, the primary reason to use the TP approach is not due to a reduction in mild infections, but rather because numerous prospective and retrospective reviews have shown an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis with this method. In the ProBE-PC study, not a single case of sepsis was reported in either group, likely because sepsis is much rarer than other types of infectious complications.",
            "in a recent update of the PREVENT trial, no infections were reported in 372 cases using the TP approach, compared with six infections out of 370 cases in the TR group, showing a differ- ence of -1% (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01). Although sepsis is a relatively rare event, making most studies underpow- ered to detect significant differences, it appears that the TP approach offers advantages over the TR approach.",
            "TP-Tbx, traditionally associated with higher costs due to the need for general anesthesia and more complex equipment, has seen these barriers reduced with the adaptation to local anesthesia, simpler instrumentation, and biopsy strategy (freehand vs template biopsy). In contrast, TR-Tbx, despite lower upfront procedu- ral costs, may incur significant additional costs and logisti- cal challenges due to the necessity of preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis.",
            "coupled with ongoing shifts toward TP-Tbx in local anesthe- sia, support a reconsideration of current biopsy protocols, potentially favoring TP-Tbx as a standard practice.",
            "Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of TP-Tbx over TR-Tbx. Both methods have similar rates of PCa detec- tion, infection, urinary retention, and biopsy-associated pain. Notably, TP-Tbx could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with the goals of effective antibiotic stewardship and reducing reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics, important factors in choosing the optimal biopsy technique.",
            "gests that TP-Tbx may result in lower rates of sepsis; how- ever, these findings are not yet statistically significant. This directionality in key outcomes, such as infection and sepsis, appears to favor TP-Tbx, warranting further investigation to confirm these potential advantages."

        "Despite transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) being the decades-long gold standard and remaining widely performed for practical reasons, the European Association of Urology (EAU) now recommends transperineal prostate biopsy (TPPB) due to its documented lower rates of infectious complications, hospitalization, and sepsis.",
        "To prevent infectious complications from TransRectal Prostate Biopsy (TRPB), antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory, although the previous gold standard Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are no longer accepted in the EU for this indication. The current EAU guidelines recommend an algorithm for TRPB prophylaxis, which prioritizes targeted prophylaxis based on rectal swab results (though not always feasible), and also advises povidone-iodine rectal preparation.",
        "Urological surgeons must prioritize a vigilant aseptic environment through proper instrument cleaning, operating room protocols, and meticulous disinfection. They should also establish written local guidelines based on knowledge of local pathogen prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence, incorporating strategies such as targeted, augmented, or alternative antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended for transrectal prostate biopsy, with options including targeted or augmented regimens (though augmented contravenes stewardship), or alternative antibiotics such as fosfomycin trometamol (e.g., 3g before and 3g 24-48h after biopsy), cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone 1g i.m.; cefixime 400mg p.o. for 3d), or aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin 3mg/kg i.v.; amikacin 15mg/kg i.m.). Urologists must note that the indication for fosfomycin trometamol for prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany due to a lack of necessary pharmacokinetic data, requiring a check of local guidance for its use.",
        "Accordingly, various precautions, such as the transperineal method, were tried to be taken, as infection is less common with this approach.",
        "TRUS-PB remains the most commonly used and gold standard method for prostate cancer diagnosis, despite its association with high morbidity and complications such as infection, hospitalization, and sepsis.",
        "Biopsy-related complications (infection, hospitalization, sepsis) are concerning, with transrectal biopsy having significantly higher rates of sepsis-related hospitalization compared to transperineal biopsy, which saw no hospitalizations in one study of 245 patients and only 5 out of 6609 patients hospitalized for sepsis in a 16-article review. To mitigate this, current urology guidelines recommend povidone-iodine rectal cleaning alongside antibiotic prophylaxis before biopsy if local infectious complication rates are high, as antiseptic rectal cleaning is a validated method for reducing complications.",
        "For biopsy-naive individuals, the transperineal (LATP) approach resulted in greater detection of GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer (60% vs 54% for TRUS) and is being considered by physicians to reduce infectious complications; however, no statistically significant differences were found in overall biopsy-related complications, urinary retention, urinary symptoms, or sexual function at 4 months, providing crucial data for clinicians, guidelines, and policymakers regarding these trade-offs.",
        "The TRANSLATE study demonstrated fewer infections and post-biopsy infection hospitalizations following transperineal (LATP) versus transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsies, although the difference in overall infections was not statistically significant. Critically for antibiotic stewardship, 89% of LATP biopsies in TRANSLATE were safely performed without antibiotics (with 11% receiving them largely due to protocol deviations), which occurred in centres not routinely using enhanced or rectal culture-guided prophylaxis, consistent with UK practice.",
        "LATP resulted in significantly fewer biopsy-related hospitalizations for infection, with 1 (<1%) of 562 at 7 days and 2 (<1%) of 562 at 35 days, compared to TRUS, which had 7 (1%) of 564 at 7 days and 9 (2%) of 564 at 35 days. This superior infection control, observed even though 89% of LATP procedures were performed without antibiotics (using chlorhexidine skin preparation) while all TRUS procedures involved pre/post-procedure antibiotics, is a key factor driving the transition to LATP due to concerns about post-biopsy urinary sepsis and other infectious complications.",
        "While transperineal (LATP) biopsy shows fewer infectious complications (1% vs 2% for TRUS) and numerically fewer serious adverse events (2% vs 4% for TRUS, though not statistically significant), it is also more commonly reported as immediately painful and embarrassing (38% vs 27%) despite leading to more adequate sampling, while TRUS has higher procedure-related symptoms at 7 days. This evidence informs urologists after a period of ad-hoc LATP adoption driven by a lack of Level 1 evidence and earlier inconclusive randomized controlled trials.",
        "Local anaesthetic ultrasound-guided transperineal biopsy (LATP) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach, developed to improve cancer detection and reduce post-biopsy infection rates, especially given concerns about infectious complications following TRUS biopsy (expedited during the COVID-19 pandemic) and its perceived superiority for targeting MRI-visible anterior and apical lesions; however, uncertainty remains regarding prostate sampling, infection rates, tolerability, side-effects, and cost-effectiveness.",
        "Participants were 93% White British, resulting in an under-representation of multi-ethnic groups. This occurred partly because TRANSLATE could not include London and many other major UK cities, which would have increased diversity, as hospitals in these locations had already wholly transitioned to LATP.",
        "Prostate cancer diagnosis requires biopsy, which for decades has traditionally been performed via the transrectal route (TRUS) with ultrasound guidance, often under local anaesthetic. Annually, hundreds of thousands of these biopsies are conducted (e.g., 70,000 in the UK, 350,000 in the USA), with over 1 million procedures performed in the USA alone.",
        "LATP biopsy procedures took longer to perform than TRUS, specifically a median of 28 minutes [IQR 23\u201335] for time in the room (vs 22 minutes [19-26] for TRUS) and 12 minutes [10-15] to perform the biopsy (vs 8 minutes [6-10] for TRUS).",
        "The TRANSLATE trial provides randomized controlled trial evidence on prostate biopsy types for outpatient diagnostic evaluation of possible prostate cancer, with its findings informing patients, clinicians, clinical guidelines, and policymakers about important trade-offs between LATP and TRUS prostate biopsy. These findings are relevant to guidelines such as the EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG guidelines on prostate cancer-2024 update by Cornford P, van den Bergh RCN, Briers E, et al.",
        "The transperineal approach is the preferred prostate biopsy route due to a lower risk of infectious complications and better antibiotic stewardship, requiring perineal cleansing and antibiotic prophylaxis. If transperineal biopsy is not feasible, the transrectal route is a second choice, requiring povidone-iodine rectal preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis, with a meta-analysis of 1,753 patients showing significantly reduced infections when using antimicrobial prophylaxis compared to placebo/control [RR (95% CIs) 0.56 (0.40 to 0.77)]; antimicrobial selection for either procedure should be based on local pathogen prevalence, susceptibility, and virulence.",
        "The indication for fosfomycin trometamol in prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany due to manufacturers' failure to submit necessary pharmacokinetic data, prompting a critical assessment of its routine general use given reported infectious complications, and urologists are advised to check their local guidance.",
        "Do not use fluoroquinolones for prostate biopsy, in line with the European Commission's final decision on EMEA/H/A-31/1452, as they have been banned due to side effects.",
        "Transperineal biopsy is the 1st choice (\u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295), requiring perineal cleansing and antibiotic prophylaxis, while transrectal biopsy is the 2nd choice (\u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295), needing povidone-iodine rectal preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis. For transrectal biopsy, from an antimicrobial stewardship perspective, antibiotic prophylaxis should either be targeted based on rectal swab/stool culture or augmented using two or more different classes of antibiotics.",
        "Fluoroquinolones, traditionally used for antibiotic prophylaxis, now face increased resistance due to overuse, and their peri-operative indication, including for prostate biopsy, has been suspended by the European Commission. Given that most studies used fluoroquinolones, making their applicability to non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics unclear, targeted therapy based on rectal swab microbiology significantly reduces infectious complications for fluoroquinolone resistance [RR 0.52 (0.39-0.69)]; alternatively, where fluoroquinolone use is suspended, cephalosporins or aminoglycosides demonstrate comparable outcomes as individual agents (meta-analysis of two RCTs), while augmented prophylaxis lacks a standard combination and targeted non-fluoroquinolone prophylaxis lacks RCT data.",
        "The transperineal biopsy is the first choice, with the transrectal biopsy being the second choice.",
        "An updated meta-analysis of eleven RCTs (2,237 men) found that rectal povidone-iodine preparation before biopsy with antimicrobial prophylaxis significantly lowered infectious complications (RR 0.47), outperforming after-biopsy application; however, rectal enema preparation before transrectal biopsy showed no significant advantage (4 RCTs, 671 men). While routine surgical disinfection of the perineal skin before transperineal biopsy is recommended despite single RCTs showing no benefit, and extended biopsy templates had comparable complications to standard templates (10 RCTs, 2,342 patients), routine general use should be critically assessed due to infectious complications reported in non-randomized studies.",
        "Rectal cleansing with povidone-iodine is strongly recommended for men prior to transrectal prostate biopsy.",
        "A panel is awaiting ongoing RCT results before making recommendations on growing evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy, as all prostate biopsy recommendations necessitate level 1a evidence. While meta-analyses indicate no difference in infectious complications related to peri-prostatic local anaesthesia, needle guide type, needle type, needle size, or number of peri-prostatic nerve block injections, a minimum one-day administration of fluoroquinolones is recommended where allowed, and augmented prophylaxis (combining two or more antibiotic classes) has been shown to be superior to standard methods for preventing infectious complications.",
        "Infectious complications are significantly higher following transrectal biopsy (64 events among 1,638 men) compared to transperineal biopsy (32 events among 1,668 men), with a reported relative risk of 1.85 (95% CIs 1.07 to 3.19). This is further supported by an eleven-study meta-analysis of 3,306 patients, a systematic review across 165 studies with 162,577 patients showing transrectal sepsis rates of 0.9% versus transperineal 0.1%, and a UK population-based study (n=73,630) that found transrectal sepsis re-admission rates of 1.4% compared to 1.0% for transperineal biopsies.",
        "The transperineal biopsy route is preferred over the transrectal route, taking into account their feasibility under local anaesthesia, comparable csPCa detection rates, and the growing importance of antibiotic stewardship, despite potential logistical challenges; for transrectal biopsies, either target prophylaxis based on rectal swab or stool culture, or augmented prophylaxis (two or more different classes of antibiotics) should be used.",
        "The transperineal approach is recommended for prostate biopsy due to its low risk of infectious complications and better antibiotic stewardship; however, a meta-analysis indicates that infections after transrectal prostate biopsy can be significantly reduced with antimicrobial prophylaxis. Urologists should also note that the indication for fosfomycin trometamol in prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany, and local guidance should be checked regarding its use.",
        "Transrectal biopsy was associated with significantly higher infectious complications (48 events among 789 men) compared to transperineal biopsy (22 events among 807 men), with a relative risk of 2.48 [1.47\u20134.2]. For transperineal biopsy, multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate very low infection rates and no significant difference in post-biopsy infection or sepsis whether antibiotic prophylaxis was administered (e.g., 0.11% vs. 0.31% for infection; 1.35% vs. 1.22% for overall infections), suggesting it may not be routinely required.",
        "A systematic review of 165 studies involving 162,577 patients reported sepsis rates of 0.1% for transperineal and 0.9% for transrectal biopsies; additionally, a UK population-based study (n=73,630) showed lower re-admission rates for sepsis with transperineal (1.0%) versus transrectal (1.4%) biopsies.",
        "Strong recommendations for prostate biopsy include using povidone-iodine rectal cleansing prior to transrectal biopsies, routine surgical skin disinfection for transperineal biopsies, and recognizing the transperineal approach's lower infection risk; these are all strongly rated, despite low certainty data, due to their high clinical benefit, simple application, and/or statistical and clinical significance. Additionally, avoiding fluoroquinolones in prostate biopsy is strongly advised as the European Commission has suspended their use for peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis due to stringent regulatory and legal implications.",
        "Currently, guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) differ on the preferred prostate biopsy approach: AUA considers both transperineal (TPB) and transrectal (TRB) approaches equivalent (conditional recommendation; evidence level: Grade C), while EAU unequivocally favors TPB over TRB due to a lower risk of infectious complications (strong recommendation) [5-7].",
        "From pragmatic and forward-looking perspectives, the transperineal biopsy approach, which current studies suggest does not require PAP, should be favored over the transrectal approach, which will always necessitate PAP [20]. This is particularly noteworthy for prostate biopsy, as the global incidence of prostate cancer and consequently the frequency of histological confirmations through biopsy are projected to double by 2040 [19].",
        "Transrectal biopsy (TRB) requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and reports ~5% infectious complications, while transperineal biopsy (TPB) rarely causes infectious complications, which PAP does not further reduce. Therefore, omitting PAP in TPB is advisable based on a systematic review, and despite this recommendation having (very) low certainty due to limited RCTs, consistent results suggest negligible patient risk, further benefiting patients by avoiding microbiome disruption and mitigating antibiotic resistance.",
        "AUA guidelines consider transperineal (TPB) and transrectal (TRB) biopsies equivalent (conditional recommendation; evidence level: Grade C), whereas EAU guidelines strongly favor TPB over TRB due to a lower risk of infectious complications. While TRB requires periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) and still reports ~5% infectious complications within a 30-day timeframe, both AUA and EAU guidelines currently recommend PAP for TPB, despite data suggesting its omission may not result in increased infectious complications.",
        "High-confidence studies, including a randomized-controlled study by Hu et al. on 658 patients, demonstrate no higher infection rates for PAP-free transperineal biopsy compared to PAP-accompanied transrectal biopsy, a finding described as an \"apples-to-oranges comparison.\" This comparison is notable given that PAP-accompanied TRB in such studies often includes pre-biopsy rectal cultures for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms and targeted PAP, raising questions about the feasibility of these efforts in routine daily practice.",
        "The transrectal punch biopsy requires antibiotic prophylaxis, while antibiotic prophylaxis can be omitted for the transperineal punch biopsy.",
        "Transrectal biopsies require antibiotic prophylaxis to significantly reduce infection rates (RR 0.56), particularly for high-risk patients, whereas transperineal biopsies can generally forgo prophylaxis without increasing infection rates (0.05% vs. 0.08%) if no infection or prostatitis is present, leading to its increased preference in European guidelines. Urologists should individually discuss these infection-related factors, along with pain management and procedure duration, to select the optimal biopsy method for each patient.",
        "The revised S3-Leitlinie Prostatakarzinom, which merged chapters on early detection and diagnosis/staging, now recommends against digital rectal examination (DRU) for prostate cancer early detection (Recommendation 4.1). This is based on confirmed low sensitivity and specificity leading to unacceptably many false-negative and false-positive findings, with further clarification of false positives carrying risks.",
        "Drei randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien zeigen vergleichbare Prostatakarzinom-Detektions- und \u00e4hnliche Harnverhalt-Raten f\u00fcr transperineale (TP) und transrektale (TR) Biopsien [98, 263, 264]. W\u00e4hrend TP-Biopsien signifikant l\u00e4nger dauern (12,7 min vs. 9,2 min; p<0,0001) [266] und unter Lokalan\u00e4sthesie durchgef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen [265], erm\u00f6glichen sie den Verzicht auf Antibiotikaprophylaxe ohne erh\u00f6hte Infektionsraten, wie Studien zeigen, die sehr niedrige Infektionsraten auch ohne Prophylaxe best\u00e4tigen [170, 171], wohingegen TR-Biopsien von einer Prophylaxe zur Infektionsreduktion signifikant profitieren [169].",
        "Die punch biopsy should be performed targeted under imaging control, including localization information, either transperineally or transrectally.",
        "Updated guidelines state that image-guided prostate core biopsy can be performed transperineally or transrectally (Rec 4.30). While transrectal biopsy requires antibiotic prophylaxis (Rec 4.32), this can be omitted for transperineal biopsy if no infection or prostatitis is present (Rec 4.35); however, transperineal biopsy is associated with increased pain perception (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.27-2.65, based on a meta-analysis of 3 studies) and a potentially longer intervention duration compared to the transrectal approach.",
        "German guidelines recommend PSA testing for men aged 45+ with a 10+ year life expectancy seeking early detection, employing a risk-adapted strategy with 5-yearly intervals for PSA \u22641.5 ng/ml, 2-yearly for 1.5\u20132.99 ng/ml, and further diagnostics for PSA \u22653 ng/ml. Concurrently, digital rectal examination (DRE) is significantly inferior to PSA, detecting only about 14% of PSA-identified tumors and lacking scientific evidence despite its historical inclusion, while prostate MRI in primary diagnostics is strengthened and recommended before biopsy after a confirmed PSA >3 ng/ml if actionable, and genetic counseling is advised for metastatic disease or familial tumor risk syndromes.",
        "Recent RCTs have shown no significant benefit for transperineal (TP) biopsy over transrectal (TR) biopsy, with TP not significantly reducing sepsis compared to TR with empirical antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to abandon TR, especially as modifications like rectal cleansing or culture-based antibiotics for TR can reduce infectious complications comparably to or better than TP, while one trial suggests antibiotics may be avoided completely before TP; however, further RCTs are needed to determine the safest overall approach.",
        "Despite guideline recommendations for transperineal prostate biopsy over transrectal, it remains unclear whether transperineal is more effective than transrectal biopsy when simple modifications like rectal cleansing and rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis are used. These proven and guideline-incorporated strategies reduce infectious complications, potentially offering comparable or even superior infection control to transperineal biopsy.",
        "There is insufficient evidence to recommend abandoning transrectal prostate biopsy, so urologists and further trials may continue practicing either transperineal or transrectal biopsy. If the transrectal route is chosen, simple modifications such as rectal cleansing or rectal culture-based antibiotics are prudent, as they reduce infectious complications comparably to or even better than transperineal biopsy, while empirical antibiotics alone are not recommended.",
        "NMA results suggest rectal cleansing may be more effective than transperineal biopsy in preventing infectious complications, including post-procedural sepsis, fever, and UTIs; however, direct comparisons are scarce, and these findings, based on indirect comparisons, carry inherent biases and limitations, warranting cautious interpretation and consideration of other factors important for biopsy route decisions.",
        "Prostate biopsies are among the most commonly performed procedures in a urologist's clinic, with over a million conducted yearly in the USA and Europe, and infectious complications, particularly when performed via the transrectal route, represent a significant healthcare problem.",
        "Our findings suggest that rectal cleansing could be the most effective strategy to reduce infectious complications, including sepsis, following transrectal prostate biopsy, being more effective than transperineal prostate biopsy and rectal culture-based antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "Prostate biopsies are performed via transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) routes. While the TR approach is associated with significant infectious complications (a major healthcare problem) and potential difficulty accessing the anterior gland and apex, recent trials have debated the difference in infectious complications between routes; despite this, a paradigm shift away from TR biopsies, known as \"TREXIT\" (transrectal biopsy with empirical antibiotic prophylaxis therapy) in the UK, is occurring in some countries.",
        "The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend TPUS-PB as the first choice due to its lower infection rate, although TRUS-guided biopsy is widely used across various clinical settings.",
        "Both transrectal (TRUS-PB) and transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TPUS-PB) are primary procedures for diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa). While TPUS-PB is the recommended approach in guidelines, TRUS-PB remains widely used despite being associated with a significant rate of infectious complications.",
        "Rectal swab-based TPAs are recommended for patients undergoing TRUS-PB for prostate cancer diagnosis because they significantly reduce the incidence of febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) compared with empiric prophylactic antibiotics; however, there is insufficient evidence to assess their effect on the risk of sepsis.",
        "The transrectal approach (TRUS-PB) is widely recommended and used, mainly owing to the transperineal approach's (TPUS-PB) complex technical demands and higher patient discomfort, with TRUS ($1869) being the least costly. Consequently, TRUS-PB continues to play an important role in real-world practice despite the theoretical advantages of TPUS-PB and MRI-guided techniques.",
        "TRUS-guided systematic or cognitive fusion targeted biopsy remains the primary prostate biopsy method in many institutions due to its low cost, procedural simplicity, short learning curve, and widespread availability. A US private insurance claims study further revealed TRUS ($1869) to be the least costly, compared to TPUS ($2849) and MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsy ($4396), reinforcing its continued important role in real-world practice despite theoretical advantages of other techniques.",
        "The EAU guidelines recommend transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TPUS-PB) as the first choice, as it allows antibiotic prophylaxis omission and is associated with a significantly lower incidence of infectious complications than transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PB) (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.92, p = 0.02), while maintaining comparable detection and complication rates, despite inconsistent findings on hospitalization and sepsis rates. If TRUS-PB, a procedure associated with a significant rate of infectious complications, is planned, a Targeted Antibiotic Prophylaxis Strategy (TPAS) based on rectal swab culture should be considered to increase patient safety by reducing these complications.",
        "The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on prostate cancer strongly recommend the transperineal approach for prostate biopsy due to its lower risk of infectious complications. While emerging evidence suggests antibiotic prophylaxis may not be necessary for transperineal biopsies, formal EAU recommendations are pending further research.",
        "The EAU guidelines on urological infections note growing evidence suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy (TPBx), a concept reinforced by Jacewicz et al.'s findings that TPBx without prophylaxis significantly lowers infectious complications and strengthens its potential to mitigate infection risk. However, the EAU Panel is awaiting the results of ongoing RCTs before issuing a definitive recommendation.",
        "Transrectal biopsy (TRBx) inherently carries an infection risk, particularly sepsis, with numerous studies consistently demonstrating it causes a higher incidence of infectious and serious complications like sepsis, substantial bleeding, symptomatic UTIs, and fever compared to transperineal biopsy (TPBx).",
        "The American Urological Association guidelines acknowledge the advantages of both biopsy approaches but maintain a neutral position due to a lack of RCTs comparing infection rates and uncertainty regarding prophylactic antibiotics for transperineal biopsy (TPBx), noting that wider implementation requires adequate training and resources. This is pertinent as a survey of US and European trainees showed less than half were exposed to TPBx and only 29% were comfortable performing it independently, leading to a suggestion that incorporating minimum TPBx cases into training requirements could enhance familiarity and adherence.",
        "Although transperineal biopsy (TPBx) was initially performed (e.g., in 1922), transrectal biopsy (TRBx) became the standard in the 1980s due to prostate ultrasound making the procedure easier, yet TPBx use is increasing again. While TRBx is still asserted to be easy, effective, and safe, TPBx completely avoids infectious complications, such as seeding bacteria from the rectum, by not passing through the rectal mucosa; this deviation from transrectal practices, termed \"TRexit,\" aims to mitigate infection risks and the emergence of resistant microbial strains while preserving diagnostic precision.",
        "In recent years, European Association of Urology guidelines have directed urologists toward using the transperineal (TP) approach, without an increasing risk of urinary retention; despite this recommendation, the choice between the transrectal (TR) and TP biopsy techniques remains a topic of debate.",
        "The choice between transrectal (TR) and transperineal (TP) biopsy techniques remains a topic of debate, with varied challenges, including significant economic factors, affecting the adoption of TP-Tbx. Current evidence shows no clear advantage of TP-Tbx over TR-Tbx, finding no difference in terms of clinically significant prostate cancer.",
        "Both biopsy approaches demonstrate similar rates of PCa detection, including csPCa, infection, urinary retention, and biopsy-associated pain, ensuring diagnostic efficacy is not compromised. Furthermore, both methods exhibit low overall toxicity and are generally considered safe for clinical use.",
        "Preliminary evidence suggests that transperineal biopsy (TP-Tbx) may lead to lower rates of sepsis and infection, appearing to favor this approach. However, these findings are not yet statistically significant, warranting further investigation to confirm these potential advantages.",
        "Historically, the transrectal (TR) approach was favored for its less invasive nature, ease of use, quick execution, and the absence of a need for general anesthesia. The decision regarding biopsy route is also influenced by factors such as diagnostic accuracy, procedural safety, patient comfort, instrument availability, and procedure-related costs and time.",
        "Transperineal (TP-Tbx) and transrectal (TR-Tbx) biopsies yield similar results for PCa detection, urinary retention, and pain. While current evidence indicates generally comparable infection rates and no clear overall advantage for TP-Tbx, it uniquely allows safe antibiotic omission, supporting antibiotic stewardship, and shows a non-statistically significant directional favorability for infections and sepsis.",
        "These results, coupled with ongoing shifts toward TP-Tbx in local anesthesia, support a reconsideration of current biopsy protocols, potentially favoring TP-Tbx as a standard practice.",
        "Despite sepsis being a relatively rare event that often underpowers studies, the transperineal (TP) approach appears to offer advantages over the transrectal (TR) approach, as a recent PREVENT trial update reported no infections in 372 TP cases compared to six infections in 370 TR cases, showing a -1% difference (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01).",
        "The benefits of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and the safety of MRI-targeted transperineal (TP) versus transrectal (TR) prostate biopsy approaches are still debated, despite no significant differences in prostate cancer detection and complications between the two. Nevertheless, the MRI-targeted TP approach may be advantageous as it can be performed safely without antibiotics, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance.",
        "A systematic review of 165 studies (162,577 patients) reported a higher sepsis burden for the transrectal (TR) approach (0.8%) versus the transperineal (TP) approach (0.1%), a finding supported by one report of one sepsis case among 762 TR patients compared to zero among 783 TP patients. However, the ProBE-PC study reported no sepsis cases in either group, and overall rates for postprocedural infection (OR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8), sepsis (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.1-4.5), and urinary retention (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.1-1.6) were similar between approaches.",
        "The transperineal (TP) approach is primarily chosen because numerous prospective and retrospective reviews demonstrate an almost complete absence of postbiopsy sepsis, rather than just reducing mild infections. Conversely, the transrectal (TR) approach has a higher real-world infection rate of up to 5-7% due to rectal mucosa involvement, requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols that conflict with efforts to minimize antibiotic resistance; however, sepsis itself is a much rarer complication, with no cases reported in the ProBE-PC study for either approach.",
        "A recent update of the PREVENT trial reported no infections in 372 cases using the TP approach, compared with six infections out of 370 cases (1.6% incidence) in the TR group, showing a difference of -1% (95% CI: -3.5% to 0.3%, p = 0.01).",
        "Across three studies [12,13,15], there is a clear trend toward minimizing antibiotic use to reduce antibiotic resistance, which could align clinical practices with both economic and public health benefits.",
        "The TP approach, although often requiring more extensive preparation and potentially general anesthesia, significantly mitigates the risk of infection by avoiding the rectal mucosa, thus offering a potentially safer alternative.",
        "Despite international clinical guidelines favoring transperineal (TP) biopsies, findings suggest that excluding transrectal (TR) biopsies from current practices may be moderated.",
        "The directionality in key outcomes, such as infection and sepsis, appears to favor TP-Tbx, warranting further investigation to confirm these potential advantages.",
        "This method has increasingly been under investigation due to a higher incidence of infectious complications, which can be severe and may require hospitalization.",
        "TP-Tbx could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with effective antibiotic stewardship and reducing reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics, all of which are important factors in choosing the optimal biopsy technique.",
        "According to a binational registry [24], adoption of the transperineal (TP) approach was slower among men from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those diagnosed at regional or low-volume hospitals; while the socioeconomic gap in TP uptake has narrowed, disparities have grown for patients in outer regional areas compared with major cities and in public versus private hospitals.",
        "A meta-analysis reaffirms the lack of clear superiority of the transperineal (TP-Tbx) over the transrectal (TR-Tbx) approach for infection prevention and cancer detection; however, this study, when considering solely high-quality evidence, favored the TP approach for detecting prostate cancer. These findings suggest that despite international clinical guidelines favoring TP, excluding TR from current practices may be moderated.",
        "TR-Tbx, despite having lower upfront procedural costs, may incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges due to the necessity of preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "TP-Tbx, traditionally associated with higher costs due to general anesthesia and more complex equipment, has seen these barriers reduced by adapting to local anesthesia, simpler instrumentation, and varied biopsy strategies. In contrast, TR-Tbx, despite lower upfront procedural costs, may incur significant additional costs and logistical challenges from requiring preprocedure rectal swabs and tailored antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "The transrectal (TR) approach has a higher chance of infection due to rectal mucosa involvement, with real-world data showing rates up to 5-7% [22] and typically requiring more comprehensive antibiotic protocols.",
        "The tendency to exclude transrectal biopsy (TR-Tbx) with prophylactic antibiotics due to infection concerns could be moderated; however, the directionality of key outcomes like infections and sepsis favors the transperineal (TP) approach despite a lack of statistical significance.",
        "Antibiotic prophylaxis in transperineal (TP) biopsies is considered to have limited additional value, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles. A subgroup analysis of ten studies (comparing 741 TP biopsies with antibiotics to 1361 without) found no statistically significant difference in febrile infectious outcomes between antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches (p = 0.47).",
        "Urology association guidelines, particularly from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), present conflicting recommendations on the optimal prostate biopsy approach. The EAU strongly recommends the transperineal (TP) approach due to its reduced infectious complications, whereas the AUA provides no clear guidance, citing limited randomized controlled trial data, and deems both TP and transrectal (TR) approaches safe and appropriate diagnostic procedures.",
        "High-level evidence confirms transperineal (TP) biopsy significantly reduces hospitalization from infectious complications compared to transrectal (TR) biopsy and requires no antibiotic prophylaxis, reinforcing antimicrobial stewardship. These findings address inconsistencies in urological guidelines by supporting the European Association of Urology's recommendation of TP as the preferred approach, which is crucial for the urological community in reducing antibiotic overuse and the burden of antimicrobial resistance.",
        "The AUA does not offer clear guidance because limited randomized controlled trial (RCT) data were available during its latest update [12]. While this manuscript included ten RCTs (comprising 4188 biopsies) that extended the evidence base with recent high-quality studies and subgroup analyses consistent with earlier reviews, its power is limited by the small number of eligible studies, high risk of bias, and sparse bias data in most studies.",
        "While the American Urological Association (AUA) deems both transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) biopsy approaches safe and appropriate, the European Association of Urology (EAU) strongly recommends TP due to significantly reduced infectious complications. The TP approach demonstrably lowers the absolute risk of hospitalization for infection (0.026% vs 1.47% for TR), reducing admission odds by 77% (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54), and also shows lower rates of fever (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.90), despite both methods offering similar diagnostic power.",
        "High-level evidence confirms the transperineal (TP) biopsy route significantly reduces hospitalization risk from infectious complications compared to the transrectal (TR) route, which consistently utilizes antibiotic prophylaxis. The TP method may reduce overall infection-related morbidity and antibiotic use, and some studies suggest it can be performed without antibiotics in low-risk patients; however, further robust research in broader populations and clear international guidance are needed to standardize consistent, safe practice.",
        "Prostate biopsies, a key step in prostate cancer diagnosis, can be performed via transrectal (TR) or transperineal (TP) routes; the TP approach generally causes fewer infectious complications, allowing safe omission of periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas TR biopsies are postulated to cause less discomfort and be less resource-intensive but require antibiotic prophylaxis and carry a higher risk of severe infections.",
        "While traditional biopsies employ antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce infectious complications, the transperineal (TP) approach generally causes fewer infections and allows for the safe omission of periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis, thus significantly reducing antibiotic usage and burden.",
        "An updated meta-analysis of ten RCTs comparing transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) prostate biopsy approaches found that TP is associated with lower rates of infectious complications, including fever and hospitalization, with seven studies specifically reporting a 77% lower risk of hospitalization for infectious complications with TP compared to TR.",
        "Subgroup analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in overall infectious complications or hospitalizations when comparing transperineal (TP) biopsies with and without antibiotic prophylaxis. This suggests that for patients without risk factors, it may be considered safe to forgo antibiotic prophylaxis in TP biopsies, an approach supported by randomized data like the NORAPP trial.",
        "The analysis found no statistically significant association in sepsis incidence between transperineal (TP) and transrectal (TR) biopsy groups, despite a low overall rate (3 cases in TR, 1 in TP) and no reported mortality. However, all included studies were underpowered to effectively detect sepsis, which, combined with sepsis remaining an isolated incident, may lead to an underestimation of the true risk, particularly for TR biopsies.",
        "The included trials predominantly used fluoroquinolone-based antibiotic prophylaxis (with two transperineal group trials not using antibiotics), but fluoroquinolone use is now critically viewed due to high levels of AMR, a low threshold for acquiring resistance, and increasing awareness of their side-effect profile among providers and patients; this led to a 2018 European Medicines Agency warning and subsequent restrictions by German authorities.",
        "Literature reports transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) infection rates of 0.4-7%, including severe infections requiring hospitalization, sepsis (1-3%), and deaths (0.1-1.3%) [Stangl-Kremser 2023, Fontana 2018]. In contrast, one study population experienced no sepsis or severe urinary tract infections within two months post-biopsy, with ambulatory UTIs occurring at 0.36% (one patient) and 1.09% (three patients).",
        "Urologists should interpret the evolving guideline divergence as a strong shift towards abandoning the transrectal biopsy route due to its fundamentally higher infection rate and the withdrawal of key antibiotics like fluoroquinolones (EMA, March 2019) and fosfomycin-trometamol for prophylaxis. Instead, the transperineal approach is favored for its superior infection control, often allowing routine antibiotic prophylaxis omission if a preoperative UTI is ruled out and thorough perineal disinfection is performed, reflecting prioritizing infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship, while still requiring thorough preoperative assessment of patient risk factors and local resistance patterns.",
        "The transrectal prostate biopsy, currently the gold standard for approximately 2 million annual procedures in Europe and USA, necessitates antibiotic prophylaxis but is associated with 0.3-9.4% sepsis and 5-7% infection rates, which are increasing due to antibiotic resistance. In contrast, transperineal prostate biopsy (including MRI-fusion) permits antibiotic prophylaxis omission without raising the risk of urosepsis or severe urinary tract infections, though a consensus on this recommendation is still lacking.",
        "In March 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) withdrew the indication for fluoroquinolones for transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) antibiotic prophylaxis, and the indication for fosfomycin-trometamol for TRPB was also withdrawn in Germany due to a lack of pharmacokinetic data. Therefore, preoperative exclusion of a urinary tract infection and thorough perineal disinfection with chlorhexidine or octenidine dihydrochloride/phenoxyethanol are essential.",
        "While the transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) is currently widely performed, its path through a highly colonized intestinal area leads to a fundamentally higher infection rate with potential pathogens like *E. coli* (e.g., 1.4% compared to 0% for transperineal biopsy (TPB) without prophylaxis in a comparative study). TPB offers a sensible alternative with comparable tumor detection, significantly lower infection risk, feasibility in outpatient and local anesthesia settings, and aligns with antibiotic stewardship due to its potential without routine antibiotic prophylaxis amidst increasing bacterial resistance, thus advocating for TRPB's replacement.",
        "Regarding antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) for transperineal prostate biopsy, there is currently no consensus; the AUA offers no recommendation, while the EAU still recommends it. However, recent evidence challenges this: a 2022 meta-analysis by Castellani et al. (eight comparative studies, four retrospective, four prospective, no RCTs, low evidence certainty) reported infection rates of 0.11% with PAP vs. 0.31% without (p=0.29), and two subsequent RCTs (Jacewicz 2022; Chernyscheva 2021) and a comprehensive 2024 meta-analysis by Wolff et al. (including these RCTs and 21 non-RCTs) further found no higher rates of infection, fever, or sepsis when PAP was omitted."

Given that most studies used fluoroquinolones, making their applicability to non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics unclear, targeted therapy based on rectal swab microbiology significantly reduces infectious complications for fluoroquinolone resistance [RR 0.52 (0.39-0.69)]; alternatively, where fluoroquinolone use is suspended, cephalosporins or aminoglycosides demonstrate comparable outcomes as individual agents (meta-analysis of two RCTs), while augmented prophylaxis lacks a standard combination and targeted non-fluoroquinolone prophylaxis lacks RCT data.

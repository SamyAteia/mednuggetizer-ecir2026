Individuals were excluded if they had any previous prostate biopsy, extensive local disease easily detectable by any biopsy (prostate-specific antigen >50 ng/mL or entire gland replaced by tumour on MRI), symptoms of concurrent or recent urinary tract infection, history of immunocompromise, need for enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis, absent rectum, or inability to position in lithotomy.",

Biopsies were performed in the outpatient setting by clinicians or specialist nurses, with practitioners having performed at least 50 LATPs and certified competent by the Principal Investigator at each recruitment site.
